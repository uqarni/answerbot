PREFACE 


Extraordinary Animals is an exploration of the animal kingdom, a cherry-picking of these fantas- 
tically diverse organisms whose ways and characteristics are astounding and often stranger than 
fiction. The book covers a wide variety of animal life, including many obscure but exceptionally 
interesting creatures, the likes of which can only be discovered in the confines of specialized, very 
inaccessible textbooks. Not only is the diversity of the subject matter unique, but the content has 
been thoroughly researched for scientific accuracy and is written in a way that it is clear, engag- 
ing, and enthusiastic. 

The audience for Extraordinary Animals is basically anyone with an interest in nature — the 
sort of people who buy books from the natural history section of a bookstore or who enjoy 
nature documentaries. The main purpose of Extraordinary Animals is to highlight just how re- 
markable animals are in a way that just about anyone can read and understand. Textbooks are 
full of fascinating information, but all too often, they are inaccessible to general audiences. This 
book provides a bridge to those resources for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the 
natural world. 

In this book, you will find 120 animals separated into one of eight categories. You can dip 
into the book wherever you want to as it is not laid out so that you have to read it from cover to 
cover. Each piece contains information on how the animal is classified, what it looks like, how 
big it is, and where it lives. The main body of the piece is devoted to the extraordinary natural 
history or characteristics of the animal. A number of bulleted facts give some extra, interesting 
information on the animal. Some of the animals in the book can quite easily be found in a back- 
yard or in places that are not that exotic, and in these cases, there is a “Go Look!” section that 
gives tips on how and where to find them, how to watch them, and how to look after them in 
captivity for short periods of time. 

It was the initial intention to include a list of Web sites to which the reader could go to find 
additional information on these animals; however, the content of these sites can never be guar- 
anteed, and with the constant reshuffling of pages on the Web, links can rapidly become inactive

or useless. For those readers keen to trawl the Web for extra information, the best way is to type 
the Latin name, or perhaps the common name, into an Internet search engine. The amount of 
information on the Web today is such that there will be numerous pages on most of the animals 
in this book, but only those sites ending in ,gov or ,edu will carry information that has been thor- 
oughly researched and edited. At the end of many entries, there is a list of resources for further 
reading. These lists, as well as the selected bibliography at the end of the book, include textbooks 
andjournal articles that can be found in any decent library. Some of these books have an asterisk 
(*) appearing next to them — it is these resources that I heartily recommend you buy as they are 
a treasure trove of information for anyone interested in the natural world. 

Wherever possible, I have tried not to use jargon. There is a whole dictionary of specialized 
zoological terms, which can sometimes be confusing or difficult to say, I have tried to write in 
more general terms without using this specialized language. However, there is a glossary at the 
end of the book to explain any jargon that was unavoidable.

INTRODUCTION 


The earth, from a purely celestial point of view, is unremarkable. It is a small planet in a solar 
system orbiting a medium-sized star in a smallish galaxy, the Milky Way, which contains billions 
of solar systems. The Milky Way is but one of billions upon billions of galaxies in the incompre- 
hensible vastness of the universe. Yet, in one respect, the earth is special beyond compare. It is the 
only place we know of on which there is life. 

Life is such a small, seemingly insignificant word, yet it encompasses a fantastic diversity of 
living forms. The exact time and nature of life’s appearance on the earth has divided scientists for 
decades, and it will continue to do so because the time spans with which we are dealing are huge, 
almost impossible for us to grasp, and the evidence is fragmentary and hard to come by. 

What we do know is that the earth is very, very old — 4.6 billion years old to be exact — but 
for the vast majority of this time, it was a lifeless globe cooling from the fires of its creation, 
circling the sun in the young solar system, while being heavily bombarded by asteroids. Over 
hundreds of millions of years, the earth changed and the asteroid impacts became less frequent. 
Oceans formed and our planet became slightly more hospitable, but conditions on this primor- 
dial Earth were still very different from the comparatively balmy conditions we enjoy today. And 
then, more than 3 billion years ago, the first life evolved. Where and how are questions we can 
only make good educated guesses at, but an experiment conducted in the 1950s by scientists in 
the United States showed that lightning bolts discharged through an atmosphere, the likes of 
which could have shrouded the young Earth, could have produced biological molecules — the 
precursors of the first simple cells. Although these experiments have since been called into ques- 
tion, as more recent findings suggest that the mix of gases used by the scientists to mimic the 
atmosphere of the young earth was probably inaccurate, they do give us an idea of what may 
have happened all those millions of years ago. The complexity of these first biological molecules 
increased over the eons, eventually forming the first self-contained biological systems, which in 
turn gave rise to the first proper cells — the first life. 



xvi INTRODUCTION 


This first life was no more than simple, single-celled organisms, and these organisms had 
the earth to themselves for a long, long time. In the atmosphere that shrouded the earth at this 
time, oxygen was as good as absent, but it is thought these first life-forms created oxygen as a 
waste gas. Over more immense stretches of time, the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere steadily 
grew until oxygen became quite abundant. Then, around 700 million years ago, this simple life 
gave rise to increasingly complex forms. From that point onward, the diversity of life on earth 
exploded. Lots of different life-forms and body plans appeared, some of which were success- 
ful, spawning long, unbroken lines of descent, while others disappeared into prehistory. The 
life-forms interacted with and adapted to each other, becoming ever-more entwined. The ex- 
traordinary diversity of life on earth today reflects the relationship between organisms and their 
environment — an intricate web of interactions with the continual processes of adaptation and 
change, fine-tuning every species over time to its environment. Life-forms have become so at- 
tuned to their environment that scarcely a niche is vacant; in almost every conceivable habitat on 
earth, animals can be found. In the deepest parts of the ocean, more alien to us than the surface 
of Mars, creatures thrive. Even in the coldest and highest places on earth, you would be hard 
pressed not to see some form of animal life. To us, perhaps the most bizarre place to live is inside 
another animal, yet many creatures have taken to this parasitic way of life and have become very 
good at it. 

Traditionally, scientists have classified life on earth into five different kingdoms based primar- 
ily on shared characteristics. This system has undergone many modifications, but it is straight- 
forward and I use it in this book to describe how animal life is categorized. This system of 
classification is hierarchical, starting with the kindgom level, followed by phylum, class, order, 
family, genus, and species. Organisms are named by a two-word system, the genus followed by 
the specific epithet, which together give the species’ scientific name. For example, the European 
honeybee’s scientific name is Apis (genus) mellifera (specific epithet). In this classification scheme, 
the first and most primitive kingdom is that of bacteria. Next are the plants, familiar to us as they 
dominate terrestrial ecosystems. The fungi represent the third kingdom. The fourth kingdom is 
the one to which we belong — the animals. The fifth kingdom, a sort of taxonomic dustbin, in- 
cludes the protists, organisms that do not really fit in to any of the other four kingdoms. 

The topic of this book is the diversity of the animal kingdom, but you will not find an inex- 
haustible list of all of the animals on earth between the covers of this book — far from it. Such 
a book would take years to read, and it would hardly be the sort of thing you could easily keep 
on your bookshelf. No, this is essentially a cherry-picking of the animal kingdom. It only covers 
living animals because although long extinct animals are fascinating, their lives are the stuff of 
guesstimation. Bones and impressions of long dead bodies can only tell so much. This book is a 
selection of those animals whose fantastic habits and lives really hammer home the message of 
how remarkable our planet is. All the animals you will read about are real. Some are found out- 
side your back door; others dwell in habitats where humans rarely venture. Some are miniscule, 
barely visible to naked eye, and some are massive, thousands of times larger than a fully grown 
human. Many of them are rarely seen, and there is still a great deal to learn about their lives. 

The scientists who study animals are known as zoologists, and it is these people who unravel 
the mysteries of the animal kingdom. Scientists, by their very nature, have an urge to catego- 
rize and order the things they study, and zoologists are no exception. All animal life may be 
divided into 38 different categories, or phyla. Each phylum contains animals that in one way or 
another are very similar, and they may be grouped by shared physical characteristics or genetic 



INTRODUCTION xvii 


similarities. Animals are continually being shifted within and between these phyla as scientists 
understand more about DNA and genetics. It has to be remembered that these phyla are a con- 
struct of the human mind and are merely an abstraction that allows us to make sense of the 
natural world. The number of species within these phyla is a huge bone of contention. Estimates 
range from 1.5 million to 100 million, but we may never know the true number. 

Regardless of the human need to categorize and identify things, it goes without saying that 
animals are a source of intense interest for a large percentage of the population. Perhaps this 
stems from the more primitive days of the human race when we lived in much greater harmony 
with nature. Before the days of agriculture and even civilization, our forebears would not have 
lasted long without a thorough understanding of the animals that shared their environment — 
which species they could use for food and which species they should avoid. Today, you can still 
see this impressive level of understanding in the ways of the tribes that survive in the more re- 
mote reaches of our planet. For thousands of years, aboriginal people have lived in the same way 
thanks to their intimate knowledge of the world about them. 

Today, most people’s interest in animals begins in childhood with the creatures found in 
a typical backyard, inevitably, the ones lovingly described as creepy- crawlies — the insects and 
their relatives. These animals are easy to find and easy to keep in glass jars or old margarine 
tubs. This fascination with bugs grows, and before long, you find yourself reading about other 
animals, some of which you will probably never see but whose origins, diversity, and astonishing 
lives amaze you. This book is an encapsulation of this path of curiosity, and it draws on things 
I have read and things I have seen. I hope that whoever reads this will find the animals contained 
herein as interesting as I do.

ACACIA ANT 



Acacia Ant — The ant on the acacia tree on which it lives. (Mike Shanahan) 



2 


EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Pseudomyrmexferruginea 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Formicidae 

What does it look like? This ant is a slim-bodied species, with the workers measuring around 
3 mm in length. They are orangey brown and have very large eyes. 

Where does it live? This is an arboreal ant, and it is to be found on or around a certain species 
of acacia tree that is found throughout Central America, The ants nest inside the large thorns 
of these acacias. 


A Relationship among the Thorns 

Acacia trees with their succulent little leaves are relished by a large number of herbivorous 
animals from tiny insects to huge mammals. To protect their foliage from these hungry 
mouths, they have evolved a number of ways to keep the leaf eaters at bay. Many acacias have 
vicious-looking spines, while others have leaves packed with repellent and noxious chemicals. 
Some acacias, however, have gone even further and actually depend on other animals for pro- 
tection. One such acacia, the bull’s horn acacia, has its own species of dedicated ant bodyguard. 
The relationship begins when a young queen ant, newly mated, lands on the acacia looking for 
a place to start a nest. The thorns on this acacia are great little ant havens as they are bulbous 
at their base and hollow. The queen, convinced by the odor of the tree that she is in the right 
place, starts to nibble a hole in the tip of one of the thorns, eventually breaking through to the 
cavity within. In the safety of her new nest she lays 15-20 eggs, and soon enough, these give 
rise to the first generation of workers. The embryonic colony grows, and as it does, it expands 
into more of the bulbous thorns. When the colony has exceeded around 400 individuals, the 
repayment to the acacia for lodgings can begin, and the ants assume their plant-guarding role. 
The ants become aggressive and do not take kindly to any creature they find trying to sur- 
reptitiously munch the acacia’s leaves, regardless of whether it is a cricket or a goat. It doesn’t 
take much to set them off. Even the whiff of an unfamiliar odor sees the ants swarming from 
their thorns and toward a potential threat. Herbivorous insects are killed or chased away, and 
browsing mammals are stung in an around their mouth, which quickly persuades them to look 
elsewhere for less well-defended fodder. Apart from these active defending duties, the ants also 
have gardening to tend to — they leave the tree and scout around its base looking for any seed- 
lings that would eventually compete with their acacia for light, nutrients, and water. If they do 
find any, they destroy them, and the ants even go so far as to prune the leaves of nearby trees so 
that their host is not shaded out. 

Not only does the tree supply the ants with nesting sites, but special glands at the base of the 
tree’s leaves produce a nectar rich in sugars and amino acids that the ants lap up. The tips of 
the leaves also sprout small, nutritious packets of oils and proteins (Beltian bodies), which the 
ants snip off and carry away to feed to their grubs. The grubs even have a little pouch at their 
head end which the Beltian body can be tucked into while they feast on it. 

This charming relationship between the ants and the acacias is as not as wholesome as it first 
appears. The ants will repel most herbivorous insects, but they turn a blind compound eye to 



STRENGTH IN NUMBERS

the feeding antics of scale insects, which suck the sap of the host acacia, thus weakening it and 
providing entry for disease. The ants tolerate and even protect the scale insects because they 
produce sweet honeydew, which the ants relish. 

♦ This is not the only example of a symbiotic relationship between a tree and an ant 
species. There are at least 100 species of ants that live in a close partnership with a 
plant. In return for the services provided by the ants, the plants furnish them with 
accommodation. The diversity of the relationships encompasses all the conceivable 
parts of a plant. Some plants have modified swellings on their branches and twigs, 
while others have cavities within their stems and trunks or modified roots that house 
their insect guests, 

♦ Some of these nests can be very small, only a few centimeters across, while others can 
be large and elaborate, 

♦ In South America, there is a tree, Duroia hirsute, which is sometimes found to domi- 
nate small areas of the rain forest, forming areas that the local people call “devils 
gardens.” Within special cavities on the tree’s trunk there are special cavities in which 
the ant, Myrmelachista schumanni, makes its nest. Any saplings sprouting near the 
host tree are attacked by the ants and stung with formic acid, which kills them, thus 
removing competition for their host’s resources, 

♦ In some of these relationships, the cost of the ant’s protection can be quite expensive, 
Cordia trees in the Amazonian rain forest have a kind of partnership with Allomerus 
ants, which make their nests in modified leaves. To increase the amount of living 
space available to them, the ants will destroy the tree’s flower buds. The flowers die 
and leaves develop instead, providing the ants with more dwellings. Another type of 
Allomerus ant lives with the Hirtella tree in the same forests, but in this relationship, 
the tree has turned the tables on the greedy ants. When the tree is ready to produce 
flowers, the ant abodes on certain branches begin to wither and shrink, forcing the 
occupants to flee and leaving the tree’s flowers to develop free from attack by the 
ants. 

♦ In the mangrove forests of Southeast Asia and New Guinea there lives an odd plant 
called Myrmecodia. This green, spiky, small football-sized plant clings to the branch 
or trunk of a mangrove tree. Scuttling over its surface are numerous ants, and the odd 
plant is their home. Open it and an elaborate system of tunnels and chambers will be 
revealed. Some of these chambers are the nest’s rubbish tips, and the waste therein is 
used by the plant as a fertilizer, allowing it to flourish even though its roots will never 
come into contact with the soil. 

♦ As you can see, ants have struck up some amazingly complex relationships with 
plants. On the whole, the two very different organisms help each other, but occasion- 
ally, there are freeloaders. These stories exemplify the degree to which insects and 
flowering plants have become inextricably linked over millions of years. Ever since the 
flowering plants first appeared on earth many millions of years ago, the insects have 
gravitated toward them and evolved with them, resulting in the complex relationships 
we see today.

EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


ANTARCTIC KRILL 



Antarctic Krill — A whale moving in to engulf a Antarctic Krill — An adult krill clearly showing the 

swarm of Antarctic krill. (Mike Shanahan) feeding basket formed by its forelimbs. (Uwe Kils) 


Scientific name: Euphausia superba 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Malacostrata 
Order: Euphausiacea 
Family: Euphausiidae 

What does it look like? The Antarctic krill can be about 6 cm long when fully grown, and it 
is more or less transparent, with a pair of big black eyes. The antennae are long and sprout 
from the very front of the head. The thorax bears several pairs of specialized limbs that 
form a basketlike structure. The abdomen has several pairs of swimming limbs and ends 
in a paddle called the telson. 

Where does it live? This crustacean is found in the southern waters surrounding the con- 
tinent of Antarctica. Their preferred habitat varies depending on how old they are. As 
youngsters, they dwell at great depths, but young adults and adults spend their time in 
surface waters. 

Swarming Crustaceans 

There can be few animals whose importance in the planet’s ecosystems is as great as the Antarctic 
krill. Singly, they are not that impressive. They look like a myriad of other shrimplike animals, but 
what they lack in appearance they more than make up for in sheer abundance. The life of an Ant- 
arctic krill starts as a fertilized egg, about the size of a period, sinking into the abyss. As the egg 
descends, its cells divide and differentiate to form the young larva. At a depth of between 2,000 
and 3,000 m, the baby krill hatches and begins to ascend, developing and growing as it makes 
slow but steady progress through the icy waters, sustained by the remaining yolk from its egg.

In the surface waters, the young krill that have made their way successfully from the depths 
begin to form huge groups, known as swarms. The individuals in these groups continue 
growing, and it can take between two and three years from the time they hatch for them to 
reach maturity. The swarms are composed of adults and young adults and can be huge. They 
can stretch over an area of ocean equivalent to several city blocks and can be as much as 5 m 
thick, with as many as 60,000 krill in 1 cu, m of water. From the air, one of these swarms has 
been likened to a gigantic amoeba as it moves slowly through the water, changing shape as it 
goes. The preferred food of krill are the tiny, single-celled plantlike organisms called diatoms. 
These diatoms rely on the sun’s rays for energy, using the power of sunlight to convert carbon 
dioxide and water into simple sugars — the all-important process of photosynthesis. As they are 
sun worshippers, these diatoms are only found in surface waters. They are found in such huge 
numbers that they form a kind of soup along with other minute organisms. These diatoms not 
only float freely in the water but also coat the underside of the pack ice, forming verdant lawns. 
The krill graze these upside-down pastures like tiny, multilimbed cows and also swim through 
the plankton using their front limbs like a straining basket to separate the edible cells from the 
water. They scrape these appendages clean with their mouthparts and swallow the green paste. 
They are messy eaters, and a lot of the green globules miss the crustaceans’ mouths and sink 
slowly to the seafloor. The digestive system of krill is also far from efficient, and quite a large 
proportion of what they take in is egested without being broken down. These strings of krill 
waste follow the feeding debris to the sea bottom. All of this accumulating waste is known as 
a so-called biological pump, as an incomprehensible amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, 
utilized by the diatoms, is locked away on the seafloor for around 1,000 years. This process 
is massively important in the regulation of the earth’s climate. Today we are seeing the conse- 
quences of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Just suppose that for some unknown 
reason these delicate little animals were to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow. If 
they were inexplicably whisked away, we would not only see the collapse of marine ecosystems 
everywhere, as they are eaten by so many other animals, but also the full and relentless fury of 
runaway global warming. 

♦ There are around 86 species of what can be described as krill. Regardless of the 
species, they are all considered keystone species in marine ecosystems. They occur in 
such huge numbers that many animals depend solely on them for food. The huge 
cetaceans, like the blue whale, are a good example. Their diet consists of krill and 
whatever else happens to be swimming among the swarm. 

♦ The total mass of Antarctic krill in the ocean during the peak of the season is esti- 
mated to be on the order of 125-725 million tonnes, making this species probably 
the most successful animal on the planet, in terms of biomass at any rate, 

♦ For reasons that are not fully understood, krill numbers go through cyclical peaks 
and troughs that are thought to be linked to the abundance of pack ice surrounding 
Antarctica. In years where there is lots of pack ice, it provides numerous little nooks, 
crannies, and caverns in which the young krill can shelter from their many predators. 
They appear to suffer when there is little pack ice. In these lean years, they are replaced 
as the dominant plankton animal by jelly-bodied creatures called salps. 

♦ In some areas of the Southern Ocean there are unusual places rich in nutrients, 
but where the diatoms and other photosynthesizing, single-celled organisms are

surprisingly rare. As there is no food for them, the krill are absent from these areas. 

It turns out that these odd tracts of ocean lack iron. Injecting iron gives the plantlike 
organisms what they need, and before long they bloom, attracting the attention of the 
gigantic swarms of krill. It has been suggested that ships could circle the Southern 
Ocean and inject iron into the water. This would stimulate the diatom populations 
and, in turn, the krill, providing a way of engineering the environment to increase the 
amount of carbon dioxide that is locked away in the deep ocean, 

♦ Around 100,000 tonnes of this Antarctic krill species, Euphausia superba, is taken 
every year for animal and human consumption. In Japan, processed krill is known as 
okiami. 

♦ The Antarctic krill, like all its relatives, sheds its skin very regularly. It is peculiar not 
only for the speed with which it can do this but also for its ability to grow smaller 

at each successive molt if food is scarce. The Antarctic krill can quite literally jump 
out of its old skin, leaving the skin floating in the water, where it may act as decoy to 
confuse predators.

APHIDS 

Scientific name: Aphids 
Scientific classification; 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Homoptera 
Family: Aphididae 

What do they look like? Aphids are small insects, varying in size from 1 to 10 mm. They have 
soft bodies with long, spindly legs. There is normally a pair of thin turrets projecting from 
the animal’s back end, which secrete a waxy substance. In each species there are winged and 
nonwinged forms. The mouthparts are formed into a long, thin structure called the rostrum, 
which is held under the body when the animal is not feeding. The eyes are small and rela- 
tively simple compared to other insects. 

Where do they live? Aphids are found worldwide, but they are more common in temperate 
regions. They are found on a quarter of all plant species. 

Aphids, Aphids Everywhere 

Aphids are not held in high regard. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of 
gardeners and farmers the world over. From a purely zoological point of view, however, they are 
a fascinating and very successful group of animals. One of the most remarkable things about 
aphids is their reproductive ability. In a short amount of time, a plant free from aphids can be 
swarming with them. For much of the year, many species of aphids reproduce without mating.

Aphids — A female aphid giving birth to a clone of herself. (Mike Shanahan) 


This cycle begins with a female that hatches from an egg laid in a suitably secluded spot, such as 
the deep fissures in tree bark, during the previous year. This founding female had a mother and 
a father, but due to the odd make up of the aphid’s chromosomes, a mating between a male 
and female can only ever produce daughters. These daughters survive the winter, and within 
them, they carry the seed of the new population. The founding female is already carrying a 
daughter, and within this embryo, another embryo develops — three generations in the body of 
one small animal, all thanks to the phenomenon of parthenogenesis, which enables animals to 
reproduce without sex. These daughters are born as miniature replicas of their mother, and they, 
too, give birth to further replicas, until there are huge numbers of aphids — all originating from 
the original female that survived the winter as an egg. The reproductive capacity of aphids is 
astounding. Theoretically, if all of the offspring from a single cabbage aphid managed to survive, 
there would be 1.5 billion, billion, billion aphids by the end of the season. 

During the autumn, the aphid colony will start producing males and females whose function 
it is to mate and produce the founding females for the following year. In certain species of aphids, 
some of the clones, although genetically identically to the original female, will look slightly differ- 
ent and perform certain tasks, such as guarding the colony. These castes are commonly soldiers 
with enlarged front legs and a spiky head, which is jabbed at animals threatening the colony. 
During the feeding season, the aphid colony may become too big, resulting in overcrowding 
that may kill the host plant. In these situations, the aphids start giving birth to winged individuals. 
These alates, as they are known, will leave the colony to search for new food plants. 

♦ There are more than 4,000 species of aphids, and they are believed to have appeared 
more than 280 million years ago when there were far fewer plant species than there 
are today. Around 100 million years ago, there was an explosion in the variety of 
flowering plants, and the aphids diversified to exploit this new abundance of plant

EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


species. Over the eons, the aphids, as 
with many of the insects, have evolved 
hand in hand with the flowering plants, 
resulting in some amazingly complex 
relationships. 

♦ Aphids live in colonies, and in some 
species, certain individuals have a 
specific task to fulfill, such as guarding 
the colony. The only other insects to live 
in colonies where all of the individuals 
are very closely related to one another 
and where the colony members are 
divided into castes are the ants, wasps, 
bees, and termites, 

♦ All aphids use their piercing, strawlike 

transport nutrients, as sap, to all parts 
of the plant, and the aphids gain access 
to these tubes through the leaves, stem, 
or roots. As the aphid inserts its feeding 
straw into the plant, the tip produces a 
fluid that hardens, forming a tube. To 
enter the phloem, the aphid must slowly 
rupture the plant cells, and to prevent the 
hole from healing, the aphid produces special proteins that fool the plants defense 
mechanisms. It can take a long time for the aphid to get its first sip of the plants 
fluids — anywhere between 25 minutes and 24 hours. To help digest the plant fluids, 
aphids enlist the services of bacteria or yeast. These microorganisms are present in the 
gut of the insect and feed on the sap, producing nutrients vital to the aphid. This is an 
example of symbiosis, 

♦ Much of what the aphid sucks from the plant is little more than sugary water, and so 
to stop from inflating itself with liquid, the aphid must get rid of the excess fluid as it 
is feeding. Droplets of sugary fluid, a substance that is commonly known as honeydew, 
emerge from the aphids back end. Many animals have a special taste for this sugary 
treat, none more so than ants. Ants like honeydew so much that they treat the aphids 
like cows: herding them, protecting them, and milking them. This mutually beneficial 
arrangement is another reason why aphids are so successful. Many of the animals that 
would feed on them are deterred by the presence of their ant guardians. 

♦ Aphids don’t get everything their own way. Although they have ants as minders, paid 
with honeydew, there are many animals, especially other insects, that feed on aphids or 
parasitize them. The ladybirds are one such example, as both the larval and adult stages 
of these beetles eat huge numbers of aphids. Many parasitic wasps hunt aphids, inject- 
ing eggs into their soft little bodies. These eggs hatch into small grubs and feed on the 
aphids’ internal organs, eventually killing them.

^ Go Look! 

Aphids can be found on all types of plants, including 
houseplants, garden plants, trees, and crops. You will see a 
whole array of interesting behaviors if you watch a colony of 
aphids. Typically, a colony will feed on the plant with their 
mouthparts inserted into the plant, greedily sucking the 
plants sap. If you look carefully, you may see some of the 
females giving birth to miniature replicas of themselves. If 
the colony is really crowded, winged aphids will be testing 
their wings, hoping to fly away in search of new host plants. 
On the same plant, ants could be tending the aphids, wait- 
ing patiently at the animals rear ends for drops of sweet 
honeydew to appear. To encourage the aphids to produce 
some honeydew, the ants stroke the aphids with their an- 
tennae. Stalking the aphids may be a range of predatory 
insects, including adult ladybirds and their active larvae, 
and lacewings and their fearsome looking larvae with huge 
sickle-shaped mandibles. Small maggots also hunt the 
aphids. These are the larval stage of hoverflies, a common 
sight on flowers. You may notice small flying insects buzz- 
ing around the aphids; these are female parasitic wasps. 
Watch a wasp carefully, and you will see it approach an 
aphid, touching it all over with her long antenna to ‘smell” 
whether it has already been parasitized before carefully in- 
jecting an egg into the sap suckers soft body.

♦ Plants lose many vital nutrients to aphids, which may explain the evolution of vari- 
ous defense mechanisms to discourage the aphids from feeding, such as small spines, 
hairs, scales, and secretions on all parts of the plant. 

♦ Aphids are not strong fliers, but they utilize lofty air currents to travel many kilometers, 
often flying up to reach these currents in the calm conditions of a summer evening. 

GIANT JAPANESE HORNET

ers forming a defensive ball around a giant Japanese

Giant Japanese Hornet — A worker perched on 
an index finger to give an idea of scale. (Takehiko 
Kusama) 


Scientific name: Vespa mandarinia japonica 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Vespidae 

What does it look like? The giant Japanese hornet is a large insect. The adult can be more than 
4 cm long with a wingspan of greater than 6 cm. It has a large yellow head with large eyes, a 
dark brown thorax, and an abdomen banded in brown and yellow. Three small simple eyes 
on the top of the head can be easily seen between the large compound eyes. 

Where does it live? This subspecies of the Asian hornet is found on the Japanese islands. They 
prefer forested areas where they make their nests in tree holes. 

Marauding, Hive-Raiding Hornets 

Japanese beekeepers, in an attempt to increase productivity, try to keep European honeybees 
in Japan as they produce more honey than the indigenous Japanese honeybees. However, the 
giant Japanese hornet often thwarts this enterprise. This hornet is a formidable brute of an 
insect, which is in fact one of the largest living wasps. When a hornet locates a hive of European 
honeybees, it leaves a pheromone marker all around the nest, and before long, its nest mates pick 
up the scent and converge on the beehive. The hornets fly into the beehive and begin a systematic 
massacre. The European honeybee is no match for the hornet as it is one-fifth the size, A single 


EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


hornet can kill 40 European honeybees in one minute, and a group of 30 hornets can kill a 
whole hive, something on the order of 30,000 bees, in a little over three hours. The defenseless 
residents of the hive aren’t just killed but are horribly dismembered. After one of these attacks, 
the hive is littered with disembodied heads and limbs as the hornets carry the thoraxes of the 
bees back to their own nest to feed their ravenous larvae. Before they leave, the hornets also 
gorge themselves on the bees’ store of honey. 

This amazing natural phenomenon begs the question, well what about the native Japanese 
honeybees? Do they get attacked? The answer is no, and the reason is particularly neat. The 
hornet will approach the hive of the Japanese honeybee and attempt to leave a pheromone marker. 
The Japanese honeybees sense this and emerge from their hive in an angry cloud. The worker bees 
form a tight ball, which may contain 500 individuals, around the marauding hornet. This defen- 
sive ball, with the hornet at its center, gets hot, aided by not only the bees vibrating their wing 
muscles but also by a chemical they produce. The hornet, unlike the bees, cannot tolerate the high 
temperature, and before long, it dies and the location of the Japanese honeybees’ nest dies with it, 

♦ Aside from its large size and fearsome appearance, the giant Japanese hornet also has 
very potent venom, which is injected through a 6.25 mm stinger. The venom attacks 
the nervous system and the tissues of its victim, resulting in localized tissue damage 
where the flesh is actually broken down. A sting from this insect requires hospital 
treatment, and on average, 40 people are killed every year after being stung by giant 
hornets, due to anaphylactic shock. Typically, the hornets are not aggressive animals, 
but when threatened, they will attack. An attack initially involves one individual, but 
the release of alarm pheromones will quickly attract its sisters. Not only is the venom 
dangerous, but the sting is also very painful. A Japanese entomologist said of the 
sting: “It was like a hot nail through my leg.” 

♦ Hornet workers continually forage to feed their siblings developing in the nest. They 
will take a range of insects, including crop pests, and for this reason, they are con- 
sidered beneficial. The insects they catch are dismembered, and typically, the most 
nutritious parts, such as the flight muscles, are taken back to the nest where they 
are chewed into a paste before being given to a larva. The larva returns the favor by 
producing a fluid that the worker eagerly drinks. 

♦ The fluid produced by hornet larvae has aroused interest recently as it is the only 
sustenance the adult worker imbibes during its life. This substance somehow makes 
prodigious feats of stamina possible, as worker hornets fly for at least 100 km a day 
at speeds of up to 40 km/h. The substance produced by the hornet larvae, known as 
vespa amino acid mixture (VAAM), somehow enables intense muscular activity over 
extended periods, perhaps by allowing the increased metabolism of fats, A company 
has started producing VAAM commercially, and it has apparently improved the per- 
formance of many athletes, 

♦ Not only is VAAM popular amongst the Japanese athletic community, but the fully 
grown larvae of the hornet are considered something of a delicacy and are eaten in 
mountain villages, either deep-fried or as hornet sashimi. 

♦ The defensive -ball strategy of the Japanese honeybee works because the tempera- 
ture inside the ball rises to 47°C, and the lethal temperature for the giant hornet is 
44°C-46°C, whereas the lethal temperature for the bee is 48°C-50°C.

♦ Recent studies have shown that the brains of the Japanese honeybee workers 
responsible for attacking a scout giant hornet are infected with viruslike particles. 

It is thought that the infection triggers aggressive behavior in worker bees. More 
experiments are being carried out in an attempt to understand this interaction.

LEAF-CUTTER ANTS 



Scientific name: Atta and Acromyrmex species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Formicidae 

What do they look like? Within a single nest of leaf-cutter ants there are several types of 
workers, which vary in appearance. Generally, a leaf-cutter ant is brown, and its body 
supported on long, thin legs. The mandibles are well developed, and the eyes are small. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where do they live? The leaf-cutter ants are found in Central and South America and in the 
southern United States, They like a warm, humid climate and throughout their range are 
found wherever there is sufficient vegetation to allow them to maintain a colony. 

Six-Legged Farmers 

Leaf-cutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. The workers in each 
nest are divided into several castes, all of which have a specific job to do. A colony of leaf-cutter 
ants is founded by a single female, the queen. This queen would have begun her life in another 
nest, tended and lavished with care by innumerable workers until the day she was ready to leave. 
The would-be queen crawls from the underground chambers of the nest into the open air. All 
around her there are other potential queens and males obeying with unerring synchronicity their 
reproductive instincts. The winged females and males take to the air for the first and only time in 
their lives where they meet each other in flight to mate. During this nuptial flight (the revoada), 
the female mates with perhaps eight different males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs 
to set up a colony. With her sperm bulbs full, she descends to the ground and rummages through 
the vegetation and leaf litter to find a suitable crevice or hole that she can call home. She has no 
further need of her wings, so they fall off, easing her underground activities. Safely beneath the 
ground, the queen excavates a small chamber and uses a small scrap of fungus carried in a pouch 
beneath her chin to grow a fungus garden. The fungus is integral to the success of the colony, and 
the queen took a small piece from her birth nest. She does not eat this nutritious fungus but relies 
instead on body fat and her now useless wing muscles for sustenance. She starts laying eggs, and 
the first young ants to hatch, her first daughters, will be gardener-nurses. Their responsibilities 
are to look after the fungus garden and lovingly tend further eggs produced by the queen. These 
first workers collect leaves from plants on the surface, on which the fungus grows. The queen, 
now relieved of menial tasks, can apply herself to the important job of enlarging the colony by 
pumping out eggs in huge numbers, producing different types of workers to look after different 
jobs within the nest. Some of the eggs will develop into nest generalists that will undertake all 
manner of miscellaneous tasks in the nest, while others will become foragers and excavators, col- 
lecting leaves for the fungus gardens and enlarging and maintaining the nest. Some eggs develop 
into heavy-headed workers with huge jaws whose job it is to defend the colony. After a few years, 
the nest, founded by a single female, has grown to monstrous proportions. It may descend 6 m 
underground, with a central nest mound more than 30 m across and smaller mounds extending 
out to a radius of 80 m. A single nest can take up 30-600 sq. m and contain 8 million individuals 
at any one time. One of these huge colonies operates like a superorganism, affecting the sur- 
rounding environment in profound ways. The ants can completely defoliate whole areas of for- 
est, breaking the forest up into small glades that are important to many plants and animals. In 
the lifetime of one nest, 40 tonnes of soil can be turned over and aerated and fertilized by the 
huge amount of waste produced by the colony. This amazing collective of tiny insects working 
as one is all started by a single female that in her 10-15 year life span may produce 150 million 
daughters! 

♦ There are approximately 38 species of leaf-cutter ants, 

♦ During their nuptial flights, potential queens can fly more than 11 km from their 
birth nest.

♦ The complex society of a leaf-cutter ant nest is held together by pheromones produced 
by the queen and built-in instincts. All the ants in a nest of leaf-cutters are sisters, and 
it is therefore in the interest of every individual to pull together for the sake of the 
colony. Everything that takes place in an ant nest is for the good of the colony so that 
more would-be queens can be produced to carry the colony’s genes into the future. 

♦ When a queen is spent and dies, the colony will lose its driving force and soon falter 
and collapse, 

♦ When the colony is young, the queen will produce mostly smaller workers, but as 
the colony matures, the size of the workers will increase. Scientists have found that 
it is possible to deceive the queen of a mature colony into perceiving that she is in 
charge of a young nest. This was done by removing ants from the nest, reducing its 
size, 

♦ Leaf-cutter ants are one of the only animals apart from humans to farm another 
organism. The crop in question is the fungus, and whatever its origins, it has devel- 
oped in such a close relationship with the ants that it is found only in their nests, 

♦ When a cut section of leaf finds its way to the fungus chambers, the gardener ants 
will deposit a small drop of fluid from their abdomen on the leaf with a tiny piece 
of fungus. The ant’s secretion acts like a form of fertilizer, allowing the fungus to 
proliferate through the leaf, 

♦ The fungus gardens are prone to a bacterial disease, which can spell disaster for the 
ant colony. To stop this bacterial infection in its tracks, the ants can produce a potent 
antibiotic, which is applied to the gardens in much the same way as farmers apply 
pesticides to their crops. 

♦ Starting a colony is a difficult business, and only 2,5 percent of potential queens 
will be successful. Many will be eaten during the nuptial flight or when they land, 
and many may successfully start a colony only to lose it to disease in the first three 
months. 

♦ In some parts of their range, leaf-cutter ants can be quite a nuisance to humans, 
defoliating crops and damaging roads and crops with their nest-making antics.

NAKED MOLE RAT 

Scientific name: Heterocephalus glaber

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Rodentia 
Family: Bathyergidae 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Naked Mole Rat — A naked mole rat excavating soil at the face of one of the colony tunnels. 
(Mike Shanahan) 


What does it look like? Based on looks alone, the naked mole rat must surely rate as one of the 
most bizarre mammals. Except for a few sensory hairs and whiskers, it is completely bald, 
pink, and wrinkly. The head is large, but much of this bulk is taken up by the jaw muscles. 

Its eyes are minute and give it a squinting look. The lips of the animal close behind the huge, 
curved, ever-growing incisors. They have hairs between their toes, allowing them to use 
their feet like miniature brooms. 

Where does it live? This rodent is a burrow- dwelling creature of arid areas and savannah in 
parts of Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia. 

Where Females Rule 

The naked mole rat is a fascinating little mammal. These creatures shun the sky and do 
everything they need to underground in extensive burrow systems, which may have 4 km of 
tunnels. Some of these tunnels are just below the surface, while others can be more than 2 m 
underground. One of these tunnel networks is occupied by one colony of mole rats, which can 
contain between 70 and 300 individuals. Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the naked mole 
rat’s life is the way that it reproduces. Like the bees, wasps, and ants, there is only one female 
in the mole rat colony that gives birth to young — the queen. No other mammal is known to 
reproduce in such a way. The queen may live for many years, producing as many as 900 pups in 
her lifetime, and it is very likely that all of these offspring will stay with the colony as dispersal 
in these rodents is very rare indeed. With migration and immigration being so low, inbreeding 
in the nest is high, so most of the individuals in the colony will be very closely related to one 
another, which is also the case for bee, wasp, and ant colonies. As the queen has a monopoly 
on breeding, all of the other individuals in the colony help to rear the young, which are pro- 
duced prolifically. The queen can produce a litter of pups every 80 days and can have five litters 
a year. The average number of pups in each litter is 12, but the record is 27, so you can see, 
these rodents know how to breed. Not only do the other colony members help to rear the 
young, but they are also responsible for finding food, tunnel making, maintaining the tunnels, 
and defending the colony. The other individuals in the colony have the biological apparatus 
needed for breeding, but their natural urges are somehow curbed. The animals all share a 
latrine where they defecate and urinate, and chemicals in the queen’s urine are responsible for 
suppressing the reproductive tendencies of the other females in the colony.

15 


With their libido quashed by the queen’s urine, the other animals in the colony can concen- 
trate on more industrious tasks. Just after the rains, when the soil is softened, the naked mole 
rats begin some frantic team digging to enlarge and maintain the tunnel network. They form 
a chain gang, with a digger at the front putting its huge teeth and jaw muscles to good use to 
scrape away the tunnel face. Sweepers behind the digger brush the loose soil to their rear with 
their feet and shuffle backward, hugging the tunnel bottom until they reach the ejector mole rat 
that kicks the soil from the tunnel entrance, forming a molehill-like structure — the only clear, 
above ground evidence of these remarkable mammals. 

♦ There are nine species of mole rat, all of which are found in sub-Saharan Africa. 

As their name implies, they are ratlike rodents that have become brilliantly adapted 
to an underground lifestyle, 

♦ Although the mole rats have a very poor sense of sight, all of their other senses 
are very well developed. They have an exceptional sense of touch, feeling their way 
around their dark burrows with the long sensory hairs scattered all over their bodies. 

♦ Not only does the naked mole have a peculiar social structure, but due to the stable 
temperature within its burrow systems, it is the only mammal that cannot regulate its 
own body temperature. It is effectively cold-blooded. When naked mole rats are cold, 
they huddle together or bask for a while in the shallow tunnels. If they are too warm, 
they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of the tunnel system, 

♦ Temperature regulation is energetically expensive and requires a lot of food, but as the 
naked mole rat has abandoned this way of life, its appetite is small. It also grows more 
slowly than similarly sized mammals. Its metabolic rate is much lower than other small 
mammals, so its longevity is considerably extended. In captivity, queens can live for 
more than 20 years, which is astonishing for such a small mammal. 

♦ Naked mole rats feed on roots and tubers located by burrowing through the soil. 
Some of these tubers are very large, and the mole rats make excavations into the 
nutritious interiors while leaving the skin intact, which allows the plant to survive 
and yield further food in the future. In some areas, the feeding activities of this 
animal can do a lot of damage to crops, especially sweet potatoes. Other mole rat 
species also chew through underground cables and undermine roadways when 
building their subterranean homes, 

♦ To increase the nutrition that can be extracted from its food, the naked mole rat has a 
high density of bacteria in its gut, and to make digestion as efficient as possible, it often 
eats its own feces. Feces are also fed to the young to inoculate their gut with the bacteria, 

♦ The skin of naked mole rats lacks a chemical called substance P. All other mammals 
have this substance, which enables them to detect pain and injury to their skin. As 
a result, the mole rat feels no pain, in its skin at least. Why this should be is a mys- 
tery, but it may be because the mole rat lives in such tightly packed communities. 
In-fighting in these communities would be very damaging to the colony as a whole; 
therefore, the lack of substance P could be a way of eliminating aggressive individu- 
als from the population. Since this rodent cannot detect wounds, molerats with a 
propensity for fighting would get wounded, and as there is no sensation of pain, the 
injuries could easily be severe enough to cause the death of the animal from blood 
loss or infection. Another possibility for the lack of substance P is as a consequence of 



16 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the high levels of carbon dioxide in the mole rat tunnels due to all the frantic activity. 
Carbon dioxide at high concentrations can be painful to the lips, nostrils, and eyes; 
but as mole rats have no substance P, they feel nothing.

A Fly that Does Not Fly 

Bats the world over are coveted by a variety of freeloaders. One group of animals in particular has 
been very successful in exploiting these small nocturnal mammals. Numerous fly species, commonly 
known as bat-flies, live on bats, typically sucking their blood with piercing mouthparts. However, on 
the island of New Zealand, there exists a bat-fly that is very different from the norm and that has 
struck up a remarkable relationship with the short-tailed bat, which is also native to New Zealand. 

Caves and other rocky nooks are in short supply on the northern tip of New Zealand’s North 
Island, so the short-tailed bat has taken to living in the hollows inside large trees, such as the 
giant, primitive kauris. In these woody refuges, the bats live together in small roosts. Alongside 
the bats lives the New Zealand bat-fly, also in small colonies. The female flies in the colony lay 
their eggs together in a nursery, and when the young maggots hatch they, too, stay close together. 
Unlike other bat-flies, the New Zealand bat-fly does not suck the blood of the bats it lives with, 
instead it gorges on the flying mammal’s droppings. This excrement accumulates in the bottom 
of the roost and is known as guano. On this nutritious diet the flies have time to engage in social 
activities. As the adult flies and their young live side by side in the bat roost, the females will 
often sidle over to the creche to groom their offspring. The adults will also groom each other, 
cleaning and caressing their colony mates with their forelegs. 

Not only is this social and maternal behavior very peculiar, but there is also what appears to be the 
beginnings of a caste system, similar to the different types of individual found in a colony of ants or 
termites. In the New Zealand bat-fly colony, some of the males live beyond their normal reproductive 
age. These elderly males take on the role of colony guards, and if a hungry bat approaches the flies too 
closely, the bat will be met with a cacophony of high-frequency buzzing produced by the guards. 

Occasionally, a colony of bat-flies will become too big for the bat roost, so some will have to 
leave and found a new colony in another roost. To do this, they climb aboard one of the resting 
bats as it dangles from its perch and burrow into the bat’s fur. There they wait for the bat to 
begin its nighttime sorties in the hope that they will be ferried to another roost. As many as 
10 bat-flies can leave the nest in this way, clinging to the fur of one bat. 

♦ The New Zealand bat-fly is quite unlike the typical bat-flies found in other parts of 
the world. The New Zealand bat-fly is actually more closely related to the flies known 
as blue bottles and green bottles, 

♦ The species ( Mystacinobia zelandica) was only discovered in 1973 by Beverly Hol- 
loway, a New Zealand entomologist, when a giant kauri tree in the Omahuta Kauri 
sanctuary fell over and an examination of its hollows revealed a roost of short-tailed 
bats and their fly cohabitants, 

♦ No other species of fly shows this level of social behavior and maternal care, 

♦ The flies have been very successful at taking advantage of birds and mammals. Several 
types, known as feeds, live on a range of mammal species, including domestic species 
like sheep. Many of these highly modified flies move very quickly and with a sideways 
crablike gait. For people who work with sheep, the sheep ked is an unpleasant element 
of their job as its bite is particularly painful. Other species live on birds and have 
become very flattened, which enables them to slip beneath the feathers of their avian 
hosts. Like fleas, the parasitic flies thrive on those animals that build nests, which pro- 
vides safety and food for their young. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The bat-fly and the short-tailed bat are two examples of the unique fauna of New Zealand 
that has developed because of geological processes. Many millions of years ago, New Zea- 
land, Australia, Antarctica, and South America were fused into a huge landmass known 
as Gondwanaland. The animals and plants of this landmass evolved along a very different 
path from those of the Northern Hemisphere. When Gondwanaland spit into the land- 
masses we see today, the flora and fauna the landmasses carried evolved still further, but in 
isolation. Australia and South America have marsupials and an abundance of unique plant 
life. Antarctica was probably very similar, but its slow drift southward saw it fall into an 
icy grip. New Zealand, for some reason, had no land mammals apart from bats, and these 
may have colonized at a later date. In isolation, life flourished, free from the tooth and claw 
of predatory mammals. Birds took to living on the ground. Insects evolved to fill the niches 
occupied in other parts of the world by small mammals, and a host of primitive plants 
flourished in the cool, moist climate. Sadly, this paradise was not to last forever, and the ar- 
rival of humans, first Polynesians and then Europeans, spelled devastation and extinction. 

♦ A second species of New Zealand bat-fly lived in association with the greater short- 
tailed bat, but both became extinct when rats invaded Big South Cape Island in 1965.

What does it look like? The Portuguese man-of-war is very bizarre. It has a large gas-filled 
bladder, tinged with blue and pink, which can be 30 cm long. Dangling in the water, below 
this bladder, are many tentacles. 

Where does it live? This animal is found in many parts of the oceans and is frequently seen 
off the coast of Europe, North America, and Australia. It may prefer warm water, but ocean 
currents and storms will often push the man-of-war north and south. 

Life on the Ocean Waves 

The Portuguese man-of-war looks like some manner of jellyfish. You could be forgiven for thinking 
this, and you wouldn’t be too far wrong. It is related to the jellyfish, but it is a quite distinct collection 
of creatures. It is not a single animal, but a close-knit colony of four different types of individual pol- 
yps, or zooids. The first of these is the bladder polyp, which is responsible for producing the gaseous 
bladder that the colony uses as a buoyancy aid. The bladder is filled with mostly carbon monoxide, 
and in times of danger, it can be rapidly deflated so that the colony can sink out of reach of a po- 
tential predator. Not only does the bladder keep the Portuguese man-of-war afloat but it also acts 
like the sail of a ship, catching the wind and carrying the colony around the seas. The second type 
of individual polyp in the colony is the feeder, whose job it is to catch food using tiny poison barbs, 
which can be shot into small fish and other sea animals. The feeders bear the long tentacles that 
hang below the Portuguese man-of-war, and when they catch some food, they contract, bringing 
the prey in reach of the tentacles of the third type of polyp — the gastrozooid, which is the stomach 
of colony that digests the food and provides nutrients lor the rest of the polyps in the colony. The 
last type of polyp is the gonozooid, whose job it is to make more colonies, producing small larvae 
that grow to become the buoyancy bladder and the other three zooids of a complete colony. 

The way in which the Portuguese man-of-war catches its prey is very interesting. The fishing 
tentacles of the colony, the dactylozooids, are armed with thousands upon thousands of stinging 
structures called nematocysts. These are beautifully adapted hunting tools. The stinger, produced by 
a special type of cell, looks like a small bulb, and inside it is a coiled thread. On the outside of the 
stinger, in the water, is a tiny hair trigger. An animal will brush past this hair and cause the bulb to 
fire, which it is does with astonishing ferocity. The coiled thread is shot from the bulb at a velocity of 
2 m per second, and for something so small, this means its tip is accelerating at 40,000 Gs (by com- 
parison, a race-car driver experiences 2-3 Gs speeding around a corner). The thread penetrates the 
prey and injects potent venom. A larger animal could tolerate the effect of one of these cells, but there 
is strength in numbers, and hundreds or thousands of nematocysts are fired at once. The venom is 
neurotoxic, and it rapidly paralyzes the prey so that it can be easily transferred to the gastrozooids. 

♦ The phylum Cnidaria is a fascinating group of animals numbering more than 10,000 
species. The Portuguese man-of-war is but one of these, and its relatives, such as the 
typical jellyfish and the anemones, are very familiar animals whose beauty can only be 
appreciated when they are seen in water. Their soft bodies, composed mostly of water,

lose their shape when they are washed 
up on the shore, rendering them little 
more than featureless blobs, 

♦ The cnidarians are an ancient group 
with the longest fossil history of any 
animal, extending back over 700 million 
years. Although anatomically simple 
animals, they successfully compete with 
organisms much more complex than 
themselves, 

♦ The venom of cnidarians is very toxic. 
That of the Portuguese man-of-war 
can cause some very painful injuries if 
a swimmer accidentally brushes against 
the long fishing tentacles. The pain is 

extreme and immediate, and the sting can even be fatal to the young, elderly, and people 
with certain allergies. The victim should be taken from the water, and an ice-pack should 
be placed on the affected area, but in no circumstances must the sting be washed with 
vinegar (a common treatment for some other jellyfish stings), 

♦ Although the sting of the Portuguese man-of-war should be treated with respect, it 
is by no means the most dangerous of the venomous cnidarians. This title belongs to 
the sea wasp, also known as the box jellyfish, which is frequently found in the waters 
off Australia and forces swimmers from the water. This animal has caused at least 
64 deaths since 1884. Death, if it occurs, happens 3-20 minutes after stinging. The 
wounds caused by nonlethal stings can be severe and often take a long time to heal. 
The reason that these innocuous-looking blobs of jelly have such lethal toxins is that 
they do not have limbs, or anything for that matter, with which to grab and immobi- 
lize prey; therefore, they use fast-acting, paralyzing venom. 

♦ The Portuguese man-of-war has developed an interesting relationship with several 
types of fish, including the shepherd fish, the clown fish, and the yellow jack, species 
which are rarely found elsewhere. The fish accompany the colony on its travels around 
the high seas. The clown fish can swim among the tentacles with impunity, very likely 
made possible thanks to skin mucus, which does not stimulate the hair triggers of the 
stingers. The shepherd fish seems to avoid the larger fishing tentacles and will feed on 
the smaller tentacles directly beneath the bladder. The presence of these fish may at- 
tract other animals on which the Portuguese man-of-war can feed. 

♦ The name Portuguese man-of-war comes from the likeness of the gas bladder of the 
colony to the sail of the old Portuguese fighting ships. 


^ Go Look! 

If you live near the coast in the eastern United States, 
you may be lucky enough to see a Portuguese man-of- 
war colony washed up on the shore or still floating in a 
pool left by the retreating tide. Because of their bladders, 
they are at the mercy of the wind and the ocean currents, 
and several may be found on a single beach after a storm. 
You will notice the bladder with its pink/blue tinge and 
the tentacles hanging from its underside. The longer ones 
are the fishing tentacles. Be careful not to touch the ten- 
tacles, because even if the animal is dead or washed up 
on the shore, the stinging cells are still active and will be 
discharged at the slightest touch.

Sponges — A section through a sponge chamber 
showing the various types of cell, including the 
collar cells (inset), (Mike Shanahan) 



Sponges — A stovepipe sponge photographed in the 
Caribbean, (Bart Hazes) 


What do they look like? The sponges have a fibrous body wall, which can be a variety of bright 
colors. They can be encrusting or upright and branching, and a whole host of shapes in 
between. Their very odd body plan is built around an elaborate network of water canals. 
Where do they live? Sponges are aquatic animals and can be found in both marine and freshwa- 
ter habitats, although the vast majority are found in the former. They are normally found in 
shallow water the world over, although some species can be found in the cold, dark depths. 

Successful Simplicity 

In aquatic habitats throughout the world, sponges abound. To the uninitiated, sponges look like 
plants or small geological features. Some cling to rocks, while others extend out into the water, 
forming thin turrets or broad columns. Nothing in the outward appearance of these peculiar 
organisms gives any indication that they are in fact animals. Among the animals, the sponges are 
the most primitive group, and to see what makes them an animal, one look must look at them 
very closely. There are no organs within a sponge, just a network of cavities and canals. Lining 
the sponge’s cavities there are so-called collar cells, which drive a current of water through the 
animal’s body and latch onto and filter whatever edible particles may be suspended in the water. 
The water-pumping ability of even a small sponge is very impressive. Each day, a 10 cm long spec- 
imen is capable of channeling more than 22L of water through the network of collar-cell-lined 
chambers, which may number more than 2 million. Most of the particles ingested by the sponge 
are very tiny, even too small for a conventional microscope to see. These particles are absorbed by 
another type of cell that looks a lot like an amoeba. As well as playing a role in digestion, these 
cells also have the ability to turn into any one of the other cells that make a fully functioning 
sponge. 

The outside of these animals is pocked with numerous pores and holes linking the interior of 
the animal to the surrounding water. Other cells in the sponge secrete an elaborate, glassy skel- 
eton of silica, while others secrete a protein called spongin that fleshes out the frame. 

In many ways, the sponge is simply an assemblage of different types of cells, and although there 
is a division of labor among these units, similar to that seen in other animals, the differentiation is 
nowhere near as complex. The simplicity of the sponge makes it a champion of regeneration. The 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


tissue of a living sponge can be forced through a silk mesh, turning the animal into a so-called 
cell soup. Other animals would be very hard pressed to recover from such brutal treatment, but 
the sponges separated cells quickly reorganize, forming themselves into several new sponges. In 
commercial sponge-growing enterprises, a large specimen may be cut into pieces, which are at- 
tached to cement blocks and then submerged. Each piece grows into a new sponge, which can be 
harvested after a few years. 

These bizarre and simple creatures were probably among life’s first attempts at an organ- 
ism with numerous cells instead of just one, but they developed along a track that spawned no 
descendents. They are, in an evolutionary sense, a dead end. 

♦ There are more than 5,000 species of sponge, and only around 150 of these can be 
found in freshwater. The rest are marine animals and can be found wherever there are 
suitable surfaces for them to attach to. They range in size from tiny species only a few 
millimeters long with an internal scaffold of calcium carbonate, to huge loggerhead 
sponges, which may be more than a meter long and wide. 

♦ It was only in the midseventeenth century that naturalists first saw the circulation of 
water inside sponges, an observation that singled them out as animals. Up until this 
time, the lack of any obvious movement and their odd internal structure led natural- 
ists to label sponges as plants, 

♦ The earliest sponge fossils are at least 500 million years old, and there are claims of 
even older fossils. Regardless of when they appeared, sponges were at the peak of 
their success during the Cretaceous period. 

♦ Along with their high silica content and the spiky nature of their skeletons, many spe- 
cies of sponges contain noxious substances to further deter potential predators. Even 
with this armory of defenses, many animals eat sponges, and some have specialized 
on a diet consisting solely of sponges. The sea turtles are a good example. The feces of 
certain turtles may contain more than 95 percent sponge fragments, 

♦ A sponge larva is a free-swimming animal, albeit briefly. It swims out of its parent 
and floats in the water for a short time before settling and developing into the familiar 
creature, 

♦ The complex internal arrangement of the sponges makes the larger species excellent 
refuges for a number of delicate aquatic animals. One large loggerhead sponge was 
found to contain more than 16,000 shrimps. 

♦ In a very interesting relationship some species of freshwater sponge are preyed upon 
by small insects known as sponge flies, which are, in fact, close relatives of lacewings. 
The female sponge fly lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae drop 
into the water and seek out a sponge to feed on. The larvae of some species cling to 
the surface of the sponge, while others explore the sheltered confines of the sponges 
internal cavities, 

♦ Sponges have long been of commercial value to people all around the world. 

The larger, cylindrical forms are valued as bathroom accessories or trinkets, although 
decreasingly so in the former use due to the availability of synthetic sponge. The 
interesting biochemistry of sponges has also attracted interest, and many compounds 
extracted from these animals are being investigated as starting points for novel 
medicines.

Scientific name: Scleractinia 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Cnidaria 
Class: Anthozoa 
Order: Scleratinia 
Family: several 

What do they look like? Corals grow in a huge variety of forms. They can be thin and branch- 
ing, moundlike, flat and spreading like a tabletop, and every intermediate form in between. 
They can be small and self-contained or huge rambling structures. The animal responsible 
for these structures, the coral polyp, is a tiny anemone-like creature, with a short, squat body 
crowned with numerous tentacles. 

Where do they live? The stony corals are found throughout the world’s oceans but are at their 
most impressive in the warm, shallow waters of the tropics and subtropics. The Indo-Pacific 
region, including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, accounts for 
the greatest abundance of stony corals. 

Many Polyps Build Great Structures 

The animal responsible for producing coral is one of the most inconspicuous creatures; yet its 
activities can fashion whole ecosystems and change the earth’s climate. To the uninitiated, a 
stony coral looks like a rock, a dead, inanimate object; however, on closer inspection, the outer 
surface is actually a thin, living veneer. Pitting its surface are numerous small pores or cups, 
each containing a small polyp, 1-3 mm across. This polyp looks like a small sea anemone, nes- 
tled in a receptacle of calcium carbonate of it own creation. Only the animal’s feeding tentacles 
project from this cup, and even these can be withdrawn and tucked out of the way of hungry 
sea animals. The polyps, like all jellyfish and their kin, are predatory. The tentacles of many 




EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


species wave serenely in the current, waiting for prey ranging from microscopic floating animals 
to small fish to come within range of their batteries of explosive stinging cells. Other species 
secrete copious quantities of mucus to entrap tiny prey and edible particles. The prey paralyzed 
by the powerful venom, is transferred to the polyp’s equivalent of a mouth. Another source of 
nourishment comes from an interesting relationship many polyps have struck up with various 
forms of single-celled, algaelike organisms. These algal cells live within the cells lining the pol- 
yp’s digestive cavity, and via the process of photosynthesis, they produce sugars and other nutri- 
ents, a proportion of which goes to the polyp. With a nourishing diet, the polyps grow quickly, 
constantly adding more calcium carbonate to their little cups. It is these small limestone cups 
that are the building blocks of a coral colony. Over decades, centuries, and even millennia, suc- 
cessive generations of polyps lay down layer after layer of calcium carbonate until the thin living 
layer surrounds a huge skeleton of what is essentially rock. The rate of colony growth achieved 
by the minute polyps, considering they are secreting rock, is extraordinary. Some of the branch- 
ing corals can grow in height or length by as much as 10 cm per year (about the same rate at 
which human hair grows). Other corals, like the dome and plate species, are more bulky and 
may only grow by 0.3 to 2 cm per year. This may not seem like much, but it can be sustained 
for thousands of years, forming huge and complex reefs. The Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of 
Australia, is the largest reef complex in the world and is composed of a multitude of coral colo- 
nies. The structure we see today is thought to be 6,000-8,000 years old, although the modern 
structure has developed on a much older reef system, thought to be 500 million years old. This 
huge reef system stretches for over 2,000 km and can be seen from space. Reefs like the Great 
Barrier Reef support huge numbers of marine organisms, and by affecting the direction and 
flow of currents, they directly affect the earth’s climate — all of this from the tireless deposition 
of rock by a minute sea creature, 

♦ The stony corals are divided into reef-building species and solitary species. The for- 
mer are the more familiar as they are found in shallow water and support huge assem- 
blages of marine organisms. The latter are found throughout the world’s oceans, even 
down to depths as great as 6,000 m. 

♦ In a coral colony, all of the polyps are genetically identical. They are all connected by a 
network of channels allowing the sharing of nutrients and symbiotic algae. 

♦ For much of the year, corals reproduce asexually. Either they spilt down the middle, 
producing two identical individuals each regenerating the missing half, or the crown 
of tentacles around the top of a polyp develops a small bud, which grows into a min- 
iature polyp that is eventually released. At other times of the year, dictated by the 
phases of the moon, huge numbers of eggs and sperm are released by female and male 
polyps or hermaphrodite polyps with both sets of sex organs. The eggs are fertilized, 
and the resulting larvae drift through the water in the hope of eventually founding 
another colony in a suitable location. 

♦ The ecosystems formed by stony coral reefs are some of the most diverse habitats on 
the planet. They are rich in nutrients and provide an intricate maze of hidey-holes for 
marine animals. For example, the Great Barrier Reef is composed of at least 400 spe- 
cies of stony and soft coral, forming a home for more than 5,000 species of mollusks 
and no fewer than 1,500 species of fish. 



STRENGTH IN NUMBERS 


♦ As the stony coral reefs form huge, natural barriers, ocean currents may be im- 
peded or redirected, allowing the build up of nutrients in areas of ocean that may 
otherwise be quite nutrient poor. These ocean currents carry heat energy around 
the earth; therefore, by altering them, the large reef systems can affect the planet’s 
climate, 

♦ Unfortunately, although the coral reefs look indestructible, they are, in fact, quite 
delicate structures and are particularly susceptible to pollution and other human 
activities. Many pristine areas of reefs have already been damaged, but it is hoped that 
with increased awareness the importance of these astonishing natural structures will 
be recognized.

Where does it live? The tar-baby termite is native to Southeast Asia where it builds its large 
nest in a wide variety of habitats. It builds its mound on the forest floor and anywhere else 
the soil is sufficiently soft for burrowing and nest making. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Ask Not What Your Colony Can Do for You, 
but What You Can Do for Your Colony 

Along with the ants, bees, and wasps, termites are the only other insects that live in colonies of closely 
related individuals. The nests in which termites live are plundered by predators galore as they are 
essentially a larder of soft-bodied, walking snacks. Against larger marauders the termites have few if 
any defenses, but smaller animals such as ants can be repelled in a number of ways. One of the most 
amazing tactics for keeping these smaller aggressors at bay is demonstrated by the tar-baby termite. 
Should certain species of ant find a breach in the walls of this termite’s nest, the occupants will first 
try to fix the breach. Although the workers are rapid builders, ants will invariably get inside the nest, 
where they seek quarry to take back to their own nest. The termite nest’s second line of defense is its 
soldiers — a distinct type of worker whose responsibility is to protect the colony. Initially, the soldiers 
use their formidable mandibles to slash at the ants to persuade them to abandon their attack. The 
termite’s mandibles are big and sharp, but in close-quarter fighting, termites will have little chance of 
stemming an ant invasion. An ant’s body is very tough compared to the soft abdomen of the termite, 
and ants also have good eyes and potent stings. Fortunately, the soldier termites have a secret weapon. 
Occupying some of their thorax and much of their abdomen is the large frontal gland containing a 
yellowish fluid. The walls of this gland are very thin, and when the termite has repelled the invaders 
as much as it can with its mandibles, it ruptures its own body wall and lets the fluid ooze out. The 
termite soldiers can also rupture themselves when they sense danger. It used to be thought that these 
soldier termites actually exploded, spraying attacking ants with the contents of their defensive gland, 
hence the names “walking chemical bombs,” “kamikaze soldiers,” and so forth. To the contrary, the 
fluid comes out slowly, but the effect is no less dramatic. On contact with the air, the fluid becomes 
very sticky. Like a miniature tar pit, the fluid traps the ants until they become hopelessly entangled. 
They die in the grip of this gloop, as do some of the defending termites. Needless to say, the split in 
the termite’s little body is severe and fatal. This suicidal gesture is the soldier termite laying down its 
life for the good of the colony. Although many soldiers may be lost defending the nest, their tactics 
must be effective as this species is very common in Southeast Asia where it is considered a pest. Not 
only can they use their powerful mandibles to pierce and slash ants, but as a last resort, they can com- 
mit suicide, taking an ant or two with them — a brilliant example of altruistic behavior, 

♦ Termites, like ants, are very successful animals. Although small and quite delicate 
insects, they possess strength in numbers. They are housed in nests that can often 
be large, very complex structures containing millions of individuals all produced by 
a single, massive queen or a group of queens at the heart of the colony. Unlike ant 
colonies, a termite colony also has kings. 

♦ There are at least 3,000 described termite species. Termites have been around for at 
least 100 million years, in which time they have evolved a huge range of defensive 
adaptations to protect their nests from predators, 

♦ The soldiers of some termite species have a large, cylindrical head, which is very 
tough. This can be used to plug the nest’s entrances and to shore up the nest if the 
walls are breached in an attack. These soldiers also have short but powerful mandibles 
to deliver a potent nip. 

♦ In some termite soldiers, the mandibles evolved into beating weapons. The semiflexible 
mandibles are pushed against one another in the same way as you click your fingers. 
One mandible is released and is used to slap the attacker. This adaptation is even more 



STRENGTH IN NUMBERS 


finely tuned in some termites where asymmetrical mandibles can only be used to de- 
liver powerful blows to the left, which are forceful enough to disable small attackers. 

♦ The soldiers of certain termites have almost completely lost their mandibles, but on 
their head they have a long nozzle that is used to squirt nasty chemicals, secreted 
by their frontal glands, at attackers. The nozzle looks like a long, thin nose, but the 
chemicals it emits are enough to kill small enemies or at least repel them. 

♦ Nozzles are also found in some soldiers with powerful piercing mandibles. The mouth- 
parts inflict a puncture wound before the nozzle squirts some noxious chemicals. 

♦ Yet more bizarre are those termite soldiers with a head that extends into a long brush- 
tipped snout. Their mandibles are small and are only used for carrying, but the brush 
at the tip of the snout is used like a paint brush to smear poisons onto their enemies. 
The chemicals daubed by this brush are very toxic to ants and other species of termites, 

♦ The tar-baby termite ruptures a gland to good effect, but other soldier termites can 
pop their gut at will. The resultant mess is far from attractive to predators. Along the 
same theme, some worker termites regurgitate the contents of their gut and rush out at 
attackers with the odorous liquid bubbling from their mouth. Other worker termites tense 
their abdominal muscles to the point where the whole hind gut pops out of the anus.

What does it look like? The trap ant is a small species. Adult workers are around 2 mm long. 
They are a golden amber color with a large head and powerful mandibles. The eyes are rela- 
tively small. 

Where does it live? These ants are native to the rain forests of South America. It is likely that 
they are found throughout the Amazon basin, but they have only been recorded from the 
east coast of South America, They are an arboreal species, spending all of their time in their 
host trees. 

Let the Food Come to You! 

The trap ant of South America is a small, unassuming insect, staying out of sight much of the time 

among the branches of a tree that they have developed a very close relationship with. For much

of the time, these tiny animals are busy in their little nest pouches beneath the leaves of their host 
tree. Catching prey is difficult if you are an ant. Most animals that you would like to get your man- 
dibles into are too big to subdue alone and may also have wings or other means of evading your 
snapping jaws. These problems are magnified for tree-dwelling ants. Even if some prey animal 
comes within range, all it has to do is leap from the trunk or branch to be carried away from the 
ant and the ants nest mates. The trap ant has evolved an intriguing way of solving this problem of 
securing prey. Beneath the branches of its host tree, the trap ant workers construct small galleries, 
which look like pock-marked areas of dense grey webbing. More intriguing still is the way they ac- 
tually build these galleries. Using hairs stripped from the surface of their host tree to act as a sort 
of fibrous matting and saliva and a specially cultivated fungus as resin, the ants construct what is 
essentially the insect equivalent of fiberglass. These galleries have been known about for a long 
time, but it was thought that they were simply a refuge for the ants while they were away from the 
nest foraging for food. As it turns out, the real purpose of these galleries is much more macabre. 
The worker ants mass in these galleries with their little heads just inside the holes, their powerful 
serrated jaws agape. Here they wait in ambush, and before long, a large, plump cricket ambles in 
to view, exploring the branch tentatively with its long limbs and sensitive antennae. The hairs that 
clothe the trees outer surface are a deterrent to walking insects. The smooth surface of the gallery, 
on the other hand, will seem like a fine place to rest or have a snack. Sensing nothing out of the 
ordinary about the ant webbing, the cricket walks straight on to it. Two or three of its clawed feet 
may probe the holes for purchase, and it is then that the waiting ants strike. They grab the ends

STRENGTH IN NUMBERS 


of the crickets legs and heave, pinning the cricket to the surface of the gallery. Other workers rush 
out and begin dragging the remaining limbs and antennae into the holes until the prey is well and 
truly snared. Other workers then swarm all over the prey and sting it. 

With the prey immobilized and at death’s door, the ants can begin their gory work. Using 
their tenacious jaws, they begin butchering the carcass of the cricket, chopping out chunks of 
flesh to carry back to the nest pouches where the developing young can be found. The prey 
is a rich source of protein for the developing ant grubs. The amazing trapping strategy employed 
by these ants ensures that the nest has sufficient protein in an arboreal environment where it 
would otherwise be lacking in this type of nourishment, 

♦ There are several species of Allomerus in the tropics. They are mostly small ants and 
all of them are specialist tree dwellers, 

♦ Allomerus decemarticulatus is the only known species of ant that collectively 
constructs a trap to snare prey, 

♦ When attacking their prey and delivering a sting, they must go for the soft parts of 
the body, such as the thin membrane between the body and limb segments. This 
arthrodial membrane as it is known can be easily penetrated by the little stinger of 
these ants, 

♦ Not only have these ants evolved a unique way of catching animals much larger than 
an individual in the colony, but the whole setup is the product of a symbiotic relation- 
ship between the ant, its host tree ( Hirtella physophora), and the fungus. The ant has 

a safe place to nest in the leaf pouches of the tree, a favor repaid by ridding the tree of 
herbivorous insects that can’t wait to get their mandibles into the succulent leaves of 
the Hirtella tree. The fungus is used as an adhesive in the construction of the traps, 
but in being so used, it is cultivated by the ants and spread to areas where it might not 
reach by itself. 

♦ There are a few spider species that build huge collective webs in which to snare prey. 
Should an insect become entangled in the silken threads, the small spiders run from 
all over the web to deliver bites to the unfortunate prey. Individually, one of these spi- 
ders would stand no hope of subduing such prey, but a multitude of fangs can quickly 
deliver a death blow to an insect massively larger than a single spider.

THE WORLD IS A 
DANGEROUS PLACE: 
DEFENSIVE TACTICS 


ARMORED SHREW 



Armored Shrew — Cutaway of the armored shrew’s body revealing its massively modified spine. (Mike 
Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Scutisorex somereni 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Insectivora 
Family: Soricidae 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


What does it look like? The armored shrew has a body length of 12-15 cm and a tail measuring 
6.8-9.5 cm. It weighs between 30 and 115 g. The fur of the shrew is dense, coarse, and gray in 
color. The animal possesses the typical shrew features: short legs, slender snout, and tiny eyes. 
Where does it live? This shrew is found in the forest belt of Africa in places such as southwestern 
Uganda, eastern Zaire, and northern Rwanda. Little if anything is known of its exact habitat 
preferences, but it is found in wet, waterlogged lowland forest with trees, palms, and dense 
undergrowth. 

Carrying a Burden on Your Back 

The armored shrew, also known as the hero shrew, is a small, unassuming insectivorous mammal, 
and for many years, it was regarded as an unremarkable, yet large African shrew. That was until 
its skeleton was examined. The spine of this animal has been called a “large bony buttress,” and 
it is the most elaborate of any backboned animal. Normally, mammals have 5 lumbar vertebrae; 
yet the shrew has 11. The structure of the bones in the vertebral column, between the rib cage 
and hips, is also unique as they sport interlocking spines on their sides and lower surfaces. These 
spines mesh with the projections on the vertebrae behind and in front, creating an incredibly 
strong, yet flexible structure. The ribs of the shrew are also thicker than those of other small 
mammals. The spine is so strong that this tiny animal can take the full weight of a man on its 
back, around 70 kg. This is approximately 1,000 times greater than the shrew’s body weight and 
is equivalent to a human bearing the weight of 10 elephants. Balancing with one foot on any 
other small mammal would kill it as the spine would simply collapse, crushing the internal 
organs, but the structure of the armored shrew’s spine is so strong that it can bear a huge weight 
and protect the delicate organs. Although the spine is very strong, it is also very flexible. One of 
these shrews in a tube or burrow little wider than its body can somehow turn 180°. 

The spine is so elaborate and modified that it accounts for 4 percent of the shrew’s body 
weight. For other small mammals, the spine typically accounts for 0.5-1.6 percent of the overall 
mass. Ironically, other parts of the shrew’s skeleton, such as the limbs, are not modified at all. 
They are not robust like the spine and ribs, but look like the limbs of any other shrew. 

Along with the vertebral column, the spinal muscles are also greatly modified. The transverse 
muscles are reduced, while the muscles that extend and flex the spine are well developed, causing 
the shrew to walk in a rather snakelike fashion. In other animals, the transverse muscles minimize 
spinal twisting, but in the armored shrew, the greatly modified spine probably fulfills this role. In 
vertebrates, the backbone is generally the most conserved part of the skeleton, showing only minor 
modifications from one species to the next. Why, then, does this shrew have such a greatly modi- 
fied vertebral column? No one knows. There is simply no plausible explanation for why the shrew 
has such a strong spine, but nature is never extravagant without reason, so there may be some 
aspect of the shrew’s life, as yet unseen, in which the amazing spine is vitally important, 

♦ Like other shrews, the armored shrew is a secretive animal, scuttling around in the 
forest undergrowth. There are few people in these areas, so it is not surprising that 
this animal is so rarely seen and so poorly known by scientists, 

♦ In the wild, the armored shrew feeds on earthworms, insects, and small amphibians. 

In captivity, it will eat bird and mammal meat. 

♦ In its homeland, the shrew is revered by local tribes. They believe it to have magical 
powers because of its ability to support the weight of a grown man without being 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 33 


squashed. They believe the animal will bestow upon them powers of bravery and make 
them invulnerable in battle. Any part of the animal, even a tiny amount of its ashes, is 
sacred, and warriors will go into battle with part of the armored shrew about their person. 

♦ There are two types of hair on the shrew’s back. Some hairs are sensory in func- 
tion, while others are used to mark territory and can be actively ejected. This scent 
marking is something the armored shrew does almost continuously. If the animal 
is placed in a cage, it will frantically scent mark its new territory, which is done by 
contorting its body into unusual positions. The scent is produced in large quantities, 
staining the fur yellow. It is thought that the odor produced by the glands along the 
flanks of the shrew is repellent to others of its own species, demarcating its home 
territory where trespassers are not welcome.

BALLOON FISH 



Balloon Fish — A balloon fish, sensing danger, a reef in its normal, nonthreatened pose. (Robert 

inflates itself in defense. (Mike Shanahan) Patzner) 


Scientific name: Diodon holocanthus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Tetradontiformes 
Family: Diodontidae 

What does it look like? The balloon fish is a boxy-looking species with an angular head and 
large eyes. In its normal, nonthreatened pose, the long spines (modified scales) on its skin 
lie flat against its body. The pectoral and tail fins are small and delicate. The skin is pale, 
and there are dark blotches on its skin, giving it a mottled look. Fully grown, the balloon fish 
can reach lengths of 50 cm. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? The balloon fish is associated with tropical coral reefs, mangroves, sea 
grass beds, and rocky seabeds. It can be found around the world. In the Atlantic, it is found 
from the Bahamas to western Brazil, and in the Pacific, it is distributed widely through the 
numerous island groups. It is a shallow water species, rarely venturing to depths of more 
than 100 m. 


In Times of Danger Inflate Yourself 

The balloon fish, with its spiky body and blotched coloration, is a handsome inhabitant of 
the warm, coastal waters of the tropics. It is a nocturnal hunter, preferring to spend the day 
secreted in crevices or small caves. When night falls, the fish leaves its daytime refuge to begin 
its prowling, closely hugging the coral or rock of its home and only rarely venturing into more 
open water. The underwater performance of the balloon fish is far from electrifying. The lit- 
tle fins and weak tail provide good stability but limited power. Luckily, the preferred prey of 
the balloon fish are not the sort of animals that can leave a hungry predator disorientated in a 
cloud of sediment. Its favored tidbits are snails, sea urchins, coral polyps, and hermit crabs, all 
of which can be rapidly dispatched with the balloon fish’s bony mouth and strong jaw muscles. 
The reef at nighttime is not the safest place to be. Many predators have retired for the night, 
but under the cover of darkness, other, fierce animals lurk. The balloon fish is just the size to be 
on the menu of many self-respecting reef predators, yet it casually searches for its dinner with 
scarcely a care in the world. This nonchalance is not without good reason, because if the balloon 
fish is threatened by a predator, it has one of the most fantastic defensive tactics in the whole 
animal kingdom. Rapidly, the fish sucks water into its very elastic stomach. The stomach keeps 
swelling until it takes up most of the fish’s body, and it keeps on distending until the whole fish 
starts to inflate. As the body grows, the spines on its surface become erect, until the fish looks 
like a huge, spiky ball. To the hopeful predator, what once appeared to be a tasty snack now 
looks pretty intimidating. Sometimes, a predator’s lunge may be very rapid, and the balloon fish 
may not have time to inflate itself and ward the danger off. In these situations, the predator may 
swallow the balloon fish, which is more than enough to trigger its defensive ploy. The swollen, 
spiky fish sticks fast in the predator’s throat, and it will take a whole lot more than mouthful of 
water or a pat on the back to dislodge it. Both the balloon fish and the predator will die in such 
an encounter, but for the most part, large reef hunters will know to give this unusual fish a wide 
berth as soon as it starts inflating. 

♦ The balloon fish is a type of porcupine fish, of which there are 19 species. They are 
closely related to puffer fish, which have a similar defensive ability, but not quite as 
pronounced. 

♦ The internal organs of these fish, such as the ovaries and liver, contain a potent toxin 
known as tetrodotoxin, which is at least 1,200 times more poisonous than cyanide. 

It acts on the nerves, disabling their ability to transmit electrical signals. Tetrodotoxin 
is produced by several types of bacteria dwelling inside the fish. Interestingly, the 
bacteria are somehow obtained from the fish’s diet. Fish bred in captivity are not 
poisonous, 

♦ In the Far East, especiallyjapan, the flesh of the puffer fish and its relatives is 

a rare delicacy. The term fugu is applied to both the fish and its meat. As food, the 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


meat of these fish requires very careful preparation by very experienced chefs. The 
toxin is not damaged by washing or cooking, and an ill-judged filleting or misplaced 
slice can easily cause the accidental, fatal poisoning of a fugu lover, 

♦ A drug called tectin has been developed from tetrodotoxin, which shows great 
potential as a powerful pain reliever that is able to dull the discomfort of cancer and 
drug withdrawal. 

♦ The balloon fish and other types of porcupine fish are also fond of nibbling coral to 
extract the succulent polyps within. The calcium carbonate skeleton of the coral is 
swallowed, and some fish have been caught with over 500 g of the crushed material 
in their stomachs. 

♦ For reasons that are not yet understood, the puffer fish and its kin have the smallest 
genomes of any known vertebrate. Their complement of DNA appears to have little 
of the surplus carried by other species. 

♦ Even out of water these fish can inflate themselves quite happily using air, but due to 
the different properties of air and water, they have difficulty deflating themselves and 
can only do so if returned to the water, 

♦ In the Far East, the dried, inflated bodies of these fish are often made into curios or 
bizarre lanterns illuminated from the inside by an electric bulb. The Pacific islanders 
once used the dried, swollen bodies to make fetching ceremonial helmets. 


BOMBARDIER BEETLES 




Bombardier Beetles — A bombardier beetle releasing a noxious cloud of gases and liquids at an inquisitive 
ant. (Mike Shanahan) 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name; Brachinus species 

Scientific classification; 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Coleoptera 
Family: Carabidae 

What do they look like? The bombardier beetles are small beetles, normally a little over 1 cm 
in length. They usually have a metallic sheen. Each of the hardened forewings is modified 
into a tough shield called an elytron, which forms a type of shell that protects the soft abdo- 
men beneath. The functional wings are below this shield, but in the bombardier beetles, 
they are tiny and completely useless. 

Where do they live? The bombardier beetles are found throughout the temperate zone. They 
can be found in a variety of habitats, depending on the species. Some prefer the moist 
conditions of deciduous forest floors, while others may inhabit dryer habitats. All of them 
depend on some sort of shelter to spend the daylight hours, such as the space beneath a 
stone or log. 


Arthropod Artillery 

The animal kingdom is full of interesting defense mechanisms. Lizards can shed their tails at 
will, moths have large colorful eyespots, possums play dead, and so forth. Many of these tactics 
pale in insignificance when compared to the defensive ploys of the bombardier beetles. These 
beetles may be small, but they certainly pack quite a punch! On the outside, these beetles look 
like any other small ground beetle, but in their behind, they carry an impressive weapon. For 
much of the time, the beetle goes about its everyday business, looking for food and mates. 
However, when the bombardier beetle feels threatened by a potential predator, a unique chain 
of events is initiated. 

Near the end of the animal’s abdomen, there are two glands. One of these produces 
hydroquinones, while the other produces hydrogen peroxide — both of which are noxious 
chemicals. These substances flow into a reservoir, which opens into an explosion chamber via a 
one-way valve. The lining of this thick-walled reaction chamber is studded with cells that exude 
enzymes called catalases and peroxidases. These enzymes break down the hydroquinones and 
the peroxides into simpler molecules with the liberation of large quantities of oxygen. The chem- 
ical reactions also cause the cocktail of molecules to heat up beyond boiling point, triggering the 
vaporization of some of the mixture. The pressure in the reaction chamber builds up and up until 
it escapes from the animal through small openings at the tip of abdomen with ferocious speed 
in a series of around 70 fast explosions, the popping sounds of which are audible to the human 
ear. The pulsing effect is due to the build up of pressure in the reaction chamber, closing off the 
one-way valve into the reservoir. Only when the contents of the reaction chamber have reacted 
and shot out of the back end of the animal can more chemicals flow in via the valve. This whole 
sequence is over in a fraction of a second. The minute canon of some similar African bombardier 
beetles can be swiveled through 270° and thrust through the animal’s legs so it can be discharged 
in all sorts of directions with considerable accuracy. The flexibility is made possible by a pair of tiny 
plates that deflect the stream of gas and liquid. The superheated cloud of noxious chemicals can 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 37 


inflict fatal wounds on other insects that 
irritate or threaten the bombardier beetle. 

The explosions can even burn the skin of 
a human who handles the insect without 
due care and consideration. 

♦ There are more than 500 species 
of beetle, distributed around 
the world, which can emit small 
explosions from their back ends. 

They are all ground beetles 
(carabids), but they are not all 
closely related to one another; 
therefore, this amazing defensive 
mechanism must have evolved 
independently in several differ- 
ent types of ground beetle. One 
possible driving force for the 
development of this adaptation is that bombardier beetles cannot fly, and taking to 
the air is a very handy way of evading those animals that would eat a tasty beetle. An 
explosive pulse of nasty chemicals shot from the behind is an excellent solution to 
the problem of defense in a flightless insect. 

♦ The bombardier beetles are predatory insects and will take a range of small 
ground-dwelling creatures, 

♦ Many insects and other terrestrial creepy-crawlies have glands that produce 
hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxides as a means of defense against various 
predators. Common examples are the small millipedes found beneath logs and 
stones. Handling one of these little creatures will make it rather angry, and it 
will begin to exude a cocktail of chemicals from pores along its body, including 
hydroquinones. These chemicals are toxic and have a distinctive smell that is more 
than enough to deter a hungry bird. 

♦ The name bombardier beetle was coined because early naturalists saw the puff of gases 
and heard the popping produced by the beetle and likened it to gunfire. Bombardier 
is a rank in the British army and refers to those soldiers involved with using large 
artillery guns. 


^ Go Look! 

There are several species of bombardier beetle native to 
the United States. They commonly look like the insect 
shown in the photograph. The elytra are normally dark 
and metallic, whereas the thorax and head are orangey. 
They are often found in moist floodplains of rivers and 
close to lakes, where temporary ponds are formed after 
storms. The easiest way to find them would be to search 
the ground or leave some pitfall traps in a potentially suit- 
able habitat. Should you find what you think to be one of 
these beetles, handling it should provide the proof as it 
will give an explosive display in protest. Look for the puff 
of gases and fluids from the rear end of the beetle and the 
popping sound of the small explosions. There are some 
species of ground beetle that look very like the bombar- 
dier beetle, but which do not share its weaponry.

BUSHY-TAILED WOOD RAT 



Bushy-Tailed Wood Rat — A bushy-tailed wood 
rat carrying a camper’s watch to add to its midden. 
(Mike Shanahan) 


Bushy-Tailed Wood Rat — An adult specimen cap- 
tured in a trap. (Tom Haney) 


Scientific name: Neotoma cinerea 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Rodentia 
Family: Cricetidae 

What does it look like? As its name suggests, this small mammal looks a lot like a rat; however, 
it has a more cuddly appearance. The body and to a lesser extent the tail, is covered in a dense 
pelage, the color of which varies with geographical location but is typically of a buff hue. The 
fur around the feet is often white. There is a great difference in size between the male and 
female. Adult males can reach a weight of 600 g, while a big female is only around 350 g. The 
eyes and ears are large and prominent, and the pointed muzzle bristles with long whiskers. 
Where does it live? The bushy-tailed pack rat is native to North America, It ranges from the 
Canadian Arctic to New Mexico and Arizona. Within this huge geographical range, it is 
found within a variety of habitats, from the cold, boreal forests of the far north to the hot, dry 
semidesert scrub habitats of the southern United States, It is often found in mountainous 
areas and can be seen apparently thriving at altitudes of approximately 4,000 m. 

Rodent Rubbish and a Snapshot of the Past 

The bushy-tailed wood rat and the numerous other wood rat species also commonly go by 
the names of pack rat and trade rat. These aliases relate to a very curious feature of the wood 
rat’s behavior. The wood rat, like any other small mammal, is a very nervous creature. It is just 
the right size to appeal to a huge number of predators, including eagles, owls, bears, foxes, 
and coyotes to name but a few. Because of this nervous disposition, the wood rat builds itself 
a shelter into which it can retreat at the first sign of danger. Most other rodents rely on burrows 
or simple holes to provide a refuge from predators, but the wood rat has opted for an all together 
more elaborate approach. At the base of a tree in a small cave, underneath a rocky overhang or 
any other secluded location, the wood rat constructs what is known as a midden. To build the 
midden, the wood rat scours its territory and collects what you and I would simply describe as 


THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


rubbish. It gathers bits of dead plant material, bones, bits of dead insects, feces, and anything 
else it can carry back to the midden. During these collecting forays, the animal appears to be 
easily distracted. If it catches sight of something that looks better than what it already has in its 
mouth, it will release what it has and grab the new object. This is often the case if it happens on 
a campsite or if it constructs its midden in human dwellings. Such places may be littered with an 
abundance of attractive objects, such as wrappers, spoons, bits of cloth, and a selection of other 
trinkets. As the rodent seems to be quite unselective in the choice of material for its mound, the 
structure grows rapidly and is soon a sprawling heap. The wood rat’s secret, though, is not its 
hording abilities, but in the way in which it sticks the whole midden together. The food of these 
animals often contains a high percentage of water and dissolved salts and sugars, which make the 
rats produce viscous urine very frequently. The rat spreads this fluid liberally over the midden, 
and the dissolved salts and sugars crystallize out of solution to hold the structure together like 
some manner of tough varnish. As the midden of the wood rat is coated in this glossy veneer, it 
can survive for a very long time indeed, especially if it constructed in a cave or underneath a rock 
overhang where it will be spared from the wind and rain. Middens in these situations have been 
dated to more than 40,000 years old. The plant and animal fragments that form these ancient 
relics are essentially fossils, but in an excellent state of preservation. Sifting through the frag- 
ments in one of these mounds can tell us a great deal about what the planet was like all those 
millennia ago. They can tell us what the climate was like and which plants were found where, 
as well as provide a glimpse of long-dead animals. Who would have thought the humble wood 
rat with its fondness for collecting rubbish would have provided us with such abundant time 
capsules showing what life on Earth was like many thousands of years ago? 

♦ The bushy-tailed wood rat is probably the most well-known wood rat, although there 
are around 21 other species, all of which are found in North America and Mexico, 

♦ As you go further north, the average size of the bushy-tailed wood rat increases. This is 
a phenomenon common to all animals, as a larger body conserves heat more efficiently 
than a smaller one, giving larger-bodied animals an advantage in cold climates, 

♦ The actual nest of the wood rat — the place where it sleeps and nurtures its young — is 
within the fortified confines of the midden. In one of these nests, a female bushy- 
tailed wood rat may give birth to three litters of young per year, each of which may 
contain as many as six young. However, the normal number is three young as the 
female only has four teats, 

♦ The word midden is believed to be Scandinavian in origin and is also used in archae- 
ology to describe a mound of discarded food items at the site of an ancient human 
settlement, 

♦ Although the midden protects the wood rat from a number of predators, animals 
such as Gila monsters and badgers can use their powerful claws to access the midden 
and the nest within. 

♦ It is often the case that a midden constructed in a good location will be used by 
successive generations of wood rats, eventually forming a huge, rambling structure. 
Some of these huge, ancient heaps can be more than 1.5 m across and contain huge 
numbers of plant and animal fragments, 

♦ Because of the sheltered conditions that it offers, the midden may be occupied by 
reptiles when it is time for them to ovewinter. The rattlesnake, normally a predator of 
the wood rat is a common lodger.

ELECTRIC EEL 




Electric Eel — Cutaway of the electric eel’s body, showing the arrangement of the muscle batteries and a 
close up of the stacked plates in the electric organ, (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Electrophorus electricus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Gymnotiformes 
Family: Gymnotidae 

What does it look like? The adult electric eel is a long, snakelike animal reaching lengths 
of 2.5 m and weights of 20 kg. In keeping with their serpentine form, they lack tail, 
pectoral, and dorsal fins; however, the anal fin is well formed and extends almost the whole 
length of the body. The whole body is cylindrical, with a flattened head and a large mouth. 
The skin of this fish ranges from grey to brownish/black with a white/yellow patch beneath 
the chin and throat. 

Where does it live? The electric eel is native to the rivers and lakes of northern South America, 
It is found in the Guyanas, Orinico, and lower portions of the Amazon River, They are 
bottom dwelling creatures, lurking amongst the mud and detritus of rivers and swamps, 
typically in heavily shaded areas. 

An Animal that Knows How to Shock 

The electric eel of South America is a sluggish creature that spends much of its time resting on the 
bottom or slinking through the muddy waters of its home. It doesn’t really need to be a fast mover, 
for it has a cunning means of defending itself and capturing food. At a glance, there seems to be 
very little about this fish that is special, and yet the electric eel, as its name suggests, has some amaz- 
ing adaptations. The vital organs of the eel are all contained within the front section of the animal 
and only take up about 20 percent of the fish’s internal volume, considerably less than other fish. 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


The rest of the eel isn’t just a fatty lump or empty space but is given over to three separate groups 
of modified muscles that have long since given up contracting to provide movement. These are the 
fish’s batteries, its electrical organs. The cells in the fish’s main electrical organ form 5,000-6,000 
disks, stacked like plates. The tiny electrical impulses produced by each of these plates are harnessed 
and channeled to produce a flow of electrical energy that is used by the fish in a number of ways. 
Normally, the electricity generated by the fish is very weak and is produced by the Sachs organ as a 
pulsating signal. This is the eel’s sixth sense, the so-called electrosense, which is distorted by inani- 
mate objects in the water and can therefore be used as a way to navigate through the cloudy waters 
of swamps and slow moving rivers, a real advantage when the visibility is close to zero. This sixth 
sense is also used to locate food. All organisms have an electrical field, and it these auras that the 
eel also detects with its electrosense, exploiting them to home in on unsuspecting aquatic animals. 
Aside from navigation and locating food, the electrical field can be cranked up to maximum by the 
main and Hunter’s organs when the eel is in danger or senses the close proximity of a sizable snack. 
In a burst of short, sharp discharges, the eel can generate 650 volts with a 1 ampere current. This 
pulsing burst of electricity travels through the water and is potent enough to kill a human or even a 
horse over a distance of 6 m. It takes the fish a lot of energy to generate these high voltages, but they 
can do it intermittently for at least an hour, maintaining the strength of each shock. 

♦ Confusingly, the electric eel is not really an eel; it just happens to look like one. It is in 
fact a type of knife fish. 

♦ The ability to generate, store, and use electricity is not limited to the electric eel. Many 
other fish share this skill. The only species able to generate voltages even partially 
comparable to the electric eel are the African electric catfish and the torpedo rays, of 
which there are 69 species. There are many other types of weakly electric fish, such 

as the stargazers, elephant noses, many types of knife fish and skate. In all of these, 
except the electric eel, the electric catfish, and the torpedo ray, the electricity is used 
to locate food or to navigate. Electricity generation is relatively rare in marine fish, 
but is more common in those freshwater species inhabiting murky water. The only 
mammal known to have an electrosense is the duck-billed platypus. 

♦ The electric eel, like many other electrical fish is nocturnal. It will hunt at night for 
anything small enough to be sucked into its capacious maw. 

♦ The battery-like abilities of the electric eel is not the only interesting characteristic of 
this fish. It is also an air breather and obtains around 80 percent of its oxygen from 
surfacing and gulping air. The oxygen enters the blood through the lining of the mouth. 
Air breathing enables the fish to live in water where there is very little dissolved oxygen. 

♦ The electric eel is also unusual for it breeding behavior. In the dry season, a male eel 
makes a nest from his saliva into which the female lays her eggs. As many as 17,000 
young will hatch from the eggs in one nest, 

♦ The powers of the electric fish are difficult to miss, and they have been known since 
ancient times. The ancient Romans would stand in a shallow bath with a torpedo 
ray and be electrocuted to alleviate the symptoms of gout, 

♦ Electric eels have always been high on the list of brave (or stupid) zoo collectors. 
Catching an electric eel is not easy, so the only solution was to make the eels tire 
themselves out with continual discharging. Some unlucky horses or mules were driven 
into a pool of water harboring a number of the fish where they would have received

enough shocks to at least knock them out. The fish’s batteries would eventually drain, 
allowing the collectors to go in with nets and stout boots.

GLAUCUS 



Glaucus — Glaucus closing in for the kill on a relative of the Portuguese 
Man-of-War. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Glaucus atlanticus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Mollusca 
Class: Gastropda 
Order: Nudibranchia 
Family: Aeolidiidae 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


What does it look like? Glaucus is a very odd looking animal. The sides of the tapering body 
bear six appendages, which branch out into thin, tentacle-like projections known as cerata. 
These contain thin saclike outgrowths of the animal’s digestive canal. The mollusk is boldly 
colored with a blue or blue-and-white back and a silvery underside, making it look as 
though it is wearing sportswear. Fully grown, they are around 5-8 cm in length. 

Where does it live? Glaucus is an animal of the open water. It is found around the world 
in temperate and tropical seas. 

Turning the Tables in an Upside Down World 

We have already been introduced to the Portuguese man-of-war and have seen the means by 
which this floating colony of animals catches food and protects itself. As with many defenses 
in the animal kingdom, they do not offer complete protection. The nemesis of the Portuguese 
man-of-war is Glaucus. Like the colonial cnidarian, this sea slug also floats around, but in a very 
novel fashion. The animal sucks air into its stomach, which acts like a buoyancy aid to keep it at 
the surface. Also, using its muscular foot, it can cling to the bottom of the surface film created 
when air meets water (the meniscus). Here, at the very surface of the water, it is at the mercy 
of the winds and currents and is pushed and pulled around the seas. Obviously, when the sea is 
calm and it is no longer buffeted by winds and tugged by currents, the sea slug can concentrate 
on hunting. Using very sensitive organs, the sea slug can detect the slight taint in the water 
indicating the presence of a nearby Portuguese man-of-war or one of it close relatives, Glaucus 
slowly makes for the source of this scent, which eventually leads to its favorite food. If the prey 
in question is a small specimen, a large Glaucus may simply swallow it in one mouthful, using 
its capacious cavern of a mouth to envelope the colonial creature. Should the prey be on the 
larger side, Glaucus will simply nibble its fishing tentacles, the ones that carry the most potent 
nematocysts, the stinging cells that are capable of delivering very painful and even fatal stings 
to much larger animals. The sea slug is unperturbed and eats the tentacles with gusto until they 
are little more than stubs. Eating a very venomous creature is impressive enough, but Glaucus 
goes one step further and turns the tables completely on its prey. It eats the tentacles contain- 
ing the stinging cells and digests everything but the stinging cells themselves. Exactly how its 
digestive system can discern between the two is not known, but the complete, undischarged 
stinging cells are carried away from the stomach and digestive sacs on conveyor belts of minute 
cilia. After feeding, the sea slug will groom its appendages, distributing its new stinging cells. 
Eventually, these cells find their way to the fingerlike tentacles of the sea slug (the cerata), which 
each contain a thin outgrowth of the gut. Slowly, they are edged to the tips of the cerata, into a 
saclike structure where they will be nourished and primed to defend the sea slug from its own 
predators, 

♦ The sea slugs, or nudibranchs as they are known, are a very diverse and successful 
group of animals. Over 3,000 species have been identified, ranging in size from 
0.4 to 60 cm, and as with any other marine, backboneless creatures, there must be 
many more to be identified. Some of the nudibranch species found in tropical waters 
are amazingly colorful and have common names, such as pajama slug because of their 
bold stripes. Many species are grazers, using their rasping mouthparts to scrape algae 
from corals and rocks, while others are active predators, feeding on a range of marine 
organisms. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Glaucus is also unusual as it spends all its time upside down. The camouflage patterns 
that you would therefore expect to find on its back are found on its front and vice versa, 

♦ The ability of Glaucus and its relatives to exploit and recycle the defensive apparatus of 
their cnidarian prey is but one of a whole selection of defensive adaptations exhibited 
by the sea slugs, which have lost the protective shell of their relatives and live, often 
exposed, in marine habitats. Some species that feed on sandy sponges have the same 
color and texture as their food, enabling them to blend in perfectly when they are sit- 
ting on a large sponge. Other species are excellent mimics of poisonous, marine flat- 
worms. Secretions are another favored tactic, and some species can exude distasteful or 
noxious chemicals from their skin glands. Normally, sea slugs are slow movers, but when 
threatened, they can swim for short distances with wild thrashings of their bodies, 

♦ The beautiful appearance of these animals makes them attractive to people with 
marine aquariums, but depending on the size of the tank, a single sea slug can kill all 
the fish inhabitants, such are its defensive abilities. 

♦ The projections (cerata) of sea slugs are not only used as a handy store for nematocysts. 
They are probably also important in digestion, increasing the surface area through 
which nutrients can be absorbed, and as they contain blood, they also function as gills. 
The food eaten by the sea slug will pass through the cerata, showing the color of the 
food that it has been eating. This may be very important in camouflage. 

♦ Glaucus is not the only specialist predator of floating colonial animals like the Portu- 
guese man-of-war. There is also a species of snail, called the violet snail ( Janthina 
janthina), that is another odd animal of the open ocean. This animal produces a raft of 
bubbles, which it coats with mucus. The mucus hardens to produce a gas-filled float. It 
finds the floating colonies of Portuguese man-of-war and similar colonial animals and 
devours them. The bubble raft is also used as a nest for the eggs, which are deposited 
on its upper surface.

GOLIATH TARANTULA 

Scientific name: Tberaphosa blondi 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Theraphosidae 

What does it look like? The goliath tarantula is brown to very dark brown. The long hairs on 
the abdomen and legs are tinged pink/ red. The front part of the body and the base of the 
limbs have a rather velvety appearance. Fully grown, the spider may have a leg span of more 
than 30 cm. Females are larger than males, with a heavier abdomen and relatively shorter legs. 

Where does it live? The native habitat of this spider is the tropical Atlantic coast of South 
America, including Brazil, Venezuela, French Guiana, Surinam, and Guyana. The natural 
habitat is the forest floor, particularly in marshy areas or swampy areas where the spider 
prefers to locate its burrow. 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 



Goliath Tarantula — A goliath tarantula flicking its defensive hairs at a hungry coati. (Mike Shanahan) 


Bristling with Defenses 

For obvious reasons, tarantulas strike fear into the hearts of many people. They are big, they 
are hairy, and they stalk around in a rather menacing manner. The largest of all of them is the 
goliath tarantula from South America, This massive, long-lived arachnid can have a leg span of 
more than 30 cm and weigh around 120 g, which is big for a land-dwelling animal that doesn’t 
have a backbone. Although the goliath tarantula and its relatives are scary looking, there is no 
real reason to fear them. They do have large fangs, but their venom is very mild compared to that 
of much smaller spiders and is no more painful than a bee sting. Although humans are often 
afraid of these spiders, in their native environment of the South American coastal rain forests, 
they fall prey to many forest animals, for whom such a large, protein-packed meal would be a 
real find. To protect itself in these forests, the goliath tarantula has evolved some unique ways 
of defending itself. Should it find itself confronted by a predator, the first thing this spider does 
is to warn the foe by rubbing its bristle clad legs together, making a rasping sound. If the preda- 
tor has come across one of these spiders before, it knows what follows these warning stridula- 
tions and backs off. If the predator is na'ive, then it presses on and further tests the spider. The 
big tarantula must then resort to its next line of defense. It presents its back end to the predator, 
and using its back legs, kicks off a cloud of small, fine hairs from its abdomen that shoot like 
miniature harpoons toward the face of whatever animal is bothering it. These hairs lodge in the 
skin of the predator, causing a painful and irritating sensation much like very potent itching 
powder. The predator, with these tiny needles stuck in its nose and around its eyes, rapidly loses 
interest in the spider as it tries to dislodge the sharp bristles. With any luck, this will be enough 
to deter even the most foolhardy enemy, but should the harassment continue, the spider may 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


have to resort to its last line of defense before it gets gobbled up. The spider rears up, appearing 
larger, and bares its formidable fangs. Little does the spider’s foe know that these impressive 
looking weapons only inject weak venom. Should all these measures prove ineffective the spider 
may be in big trouble. Unless it can find a hidey-hole, it is destined to end up as a midnight 
snack for a lucky predator. 

♦ More than 800 species of tarantula have been identified, and not all of them are 
large. Some are as little as 2.5 cm long. They are limited to tropical and subtropical 
regions. 

♦ The name tarantula was actually first used in Italy for a type of European wolf spider 
whose bite was believed to be fatal unless the victim did a wild and manic dance, 
which became known as the tarantella. The name tarantula was then used to describe 
any large spider, and so the name for these big, hairy tropical species has stuck. 

♦ These big spiders are also the most long-lived of all the spiders. Females can live for 
more than 15 years and possibly longer. 

♦ Tarantulas are also among the most primitive spiders. The accolade of most primitive 
goes to a type of trap-door spider found in Southeast Asia. Like all primitive spiders, 
the tarantula bites by rearing up and driving its fangs into its prey. 

♦ Big tarantulas are known as bird-eating spiders, but this type of behavior is very rare. 
This name stems from old illustrations that depicted tropical tarantulas looming 
over the bodies of birds they had just captured. Historical illustrators rarely based 
their drawings on living specimens and so depended on the stories handed down by 
explorers. These stories were often prone to exaggeration and embellishment. 

The goliath tarantula has been known to catch and eat fully grown mice as well as 
frogs and lizards. 

♦ All of the primitive spiders have very poor eyesight. Their eyes are tiny and are only 
good to tell the difference between light and dark. The tarantula’s most developed 
sense is touch. Its body is covered with hairs, some of which act like tiny wind vanes, 
picking up minute fluctuations in air pressure that could signal the presence of 
another animal. Exploring the world with their heightened sense of touch, they can 
make blindingly fast and accurate strikes at suitable prey. 

♦ Almost all tarantulas are nocturnal. During the day, they rest in burrows, holes in 
trees or plants, and beneath logs. When hunting, some species rarely move far from 
their burrow entrance, instead waiting for prey to blunder by. 

♦ The native Indians in South America are fond of eating the goliath spider. They are 
well aware of its defenses and are therefore very careful when capturing and subduing 
them. The bright orange eggs of the female are especially favored. 

♦ Like most tarantulas, the goliath is a popular pet. They can be easily maintained in 
relatively small containers, and as they are not the most active of creatures, their food 
intake is amazingly small. However, they are large spiders and can be aggressive.

HONEY BADGER 



Honey Badger — A honey guide helps a honey badger find a bee’s nest. (Mike Shanahan) 



Scientific name: Mellivora capensis 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Carnivora 
Family: Mustelidae 

What does it look like? The honey badger is a stocky creature with powerful limbs tipped with 
long claws. The claws on the forefeet may be 40 mm long. A white stripe runs the length 
of the body, separating the silvery coarse fur of the back from the black pelage of the rest 
of the body The fur is longest on the tail and hind limbs. It has small eyes and no external 
ears. When fully grown, they are over 1 m in length, with fully grown males weighing in at 
14 kg. Females are much smaller than males. 

Where does it live? The honey badger is an animal of sub-Saharan Africa, but it is also to be 
found through the Middle East to southern Russia, and even as far east as India and Nepal. 
They are found in a variety of habitats, from semidesert to rain forest. 

Tough and Tenacious 

Of the great diversity of mammals on the African continent, the honey badger, also known as the 
ratel, is one of the most notorious. They are often referred to as the'meanest animal in the world.” 
For a smallish animal, the honey badger has quite a reputation to live up to. Its notoriety stems 
from its tenacity and unyielding nature. The first interesting aspect of the animal’s toughness is it 
apparent ability to withstand the venom of the various snake species that it feeds on in southern 
Africa, There are reliable reports of this animal shaking off the bites of venomous snakes as if 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


they were no more than disconcerting bee stings. The ratel’s ability to survive a dose of venoms 
stems from the difficulty the snake may have in puncturing its very tough, loose, rubbery skin and 
some as yet unknown metabolic adaptation enabling the ratel to render the venom harmless. 

The ratel is a fervent fan of honey, and its partial immunity to venom comes in very handy as 
it breaks into the nests of honeybees, who unsurprisingly react with appropriate aggression. The 
ratel can take many, many stings before it retreats. Not only is the honey badger fond of hunting 
and eating venomous snakes and stealing honey from angry bees, it is also disregarding of ani- 
mals many times its own size. Lions and leopards have been known to kill and eat honey badgers, 
but on the whole, they will give them a wide birth. An angered honey badger is not a pretty sight. 
Apart from charging the animal it perceives to be a threat, it may also use chemical weapons 
and discharge a foul-smelling odor from its anal glands. Most potential predators find this par- 
ticularly repugnant and will keep well out of range of the honey badgers strong jaws and claws. 
Should the honey badger be forced to sink its teeth into a potential aggressor, it is said that it will 
often go for one particular part, the scrotum. It is said that it latches on to the pendulous purse of 
the scrotum with a tenacious grip and eventually castrates the bewildered victim. It is difficult to 
know if this is exaggeration, but the ratel is definitely not an animal to be messed with. 

♦ The honey badger is not related to either the American or European badgers. It looks 
quite similar to them, but it differs in many respects. The badgers and the honey bad- 
ger are all included in the family Mustelidae, a large group of carnivorous mammals 
that includes the badgers, weasels, tayra, wolverine, otters, and so forth. 

♦ The honey badger, although a powerful and fearless predator, is essentially an omni- 
vore, It will eat a huge variety of foods, including reptiles, rodents, birds, insects, and 
carrion. It will also take fruits, berries, roots, plants, and eggs. To obtain the latter, the 
ratel will often scale trees and steal the eggs from the nest, 

♦ Although the honey badger is obviously a very bold and tough animal, some of the 
stories surrounding it have obviously been embellished. The honey badger is difficult 
to find in the wild and even harder to study; therefore much of what is known is 
based on anecdotes, 

♦ The honey badger is predominantly solitary, although small family groups of up to 
three individuals are occasionally seen. They are nomadic and range over huge areas, 
which for adult males may be large as 600 km 2 . 

♦ Reproduction in the honey badger is a long-winded affair. Only one to two young are 
produced every 18 months or so. The female has sole responsibility for the young, and 
they will stay with her for around 14 months. 

♦ The very low birth rate of honey badgers makes them extremely vulnerable to hunt- 
ing and habitat destruction. They are often scorned and hunted by farmers who own 
commercial beehives and believe the ratel to be a threat to their livelihoods. Many ratels 
are killed by farmers or stung to death by bees after becoming snared in a hive trap. 

♦ One of the most interesting relationships in the honey badger’s life, which is still 
poorly understood, is its interaction with a bird called the honeyguide. It is said that 
these two animals work together to exploit honeybee nests. The bird goes into the 
bush scouting for nests and calls when it finds one, attracting the honey badger to the 
scene. The bird, what with its meager beak and claws, would have no hope of breaking 
open the nest, but its partner, the honey badger, equipped with powerful claws and 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


tolerance to stings, can break open the nest and extract the honey-filled combs. 

As a reward for finding the nest, the bird is allowed access to the sweet honey, 

♦ Other birds have been observed in close proximity to honey badgers, apparently 
following them around. Several individuals of the pale, chanting goshawk of South 
Africa can often be seen tailing the honey badger. It is supposed that the ratel, being 
such an active digger, flushes rodents and other small animals from cover, allowing 
the birds of prey to catch them.

HOODED PITOHUI 



turing and trying to eat a hooded pitohui. (Mike Hooded Pitohui — A specimen taken from a mist 
Shanahan) net in the hand of its captor. (John D. Dumbacher) 

Scientific name; Pitohui dichrous 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 
Order: Passeriformes 
Family: Pachycephalidae 

What does it look like? The hooded pitohui is about the size of a thrush (about 15-20 cm 
long), with a black head, wings, and tail in sharp contrast to the orange or brick red hue 
of the plumage on the body. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? The hooded pitohui is a forest bird and can be found over much of 
New Guinea, 

Not a Fowl, but Definitely Foul 

In 1989, a researcher studying birds of paradise in the forests of New Guinea was checking 
the mist nets set to trap the animals he was looking for. As was often the case, a black and red 
bird, the hooded pitohui, was struggling to free itself from the fine mesh. In freeing the bird 
from the net, the researcher received a couple of scratches, which he tried to soothe by sucking 
them. After a couple of minutes, he felt a numbing and tingling sensation in his lips and mouth. 
Had the bird been responsible for this? Later, to confirm his suspicions, he plucked a feather 
from another ensnared hooded pitohui and licked it. There was no doubt the feather contained 
some kind of toxin, and it turned out to be present not only in the plumage but also in the skin. 
Inadvertently, the young researcher had stumbled across a poisonous bird. Although toxins are 
produced by many animals, birds were not considered among their numbers, and it took quite 
a while for the young researcher to convince people that what he found was genuine. Eventually, 
an extract from the skin and feathers of a dead hooded pitohui was prepared, and the active 
ingredient was found to be a toxin very similar to that found in poison-arrow frogs, a chemical 
known as homobatrachotoxin (BTX). What was a small forest bird doing with one of natures 
most potent poisons in its feathers and skin, and more intriguingly, where was the toxin coming 
from? The poison-arrow frogs of the neotropics secrete BTX; yet it is not known how they do it. 
It is possible it is synthesized in the tiny frog’s body, but it is widely believed that the toxin, or 
at least the building blocks for it, is to be found in the amphibian’s diet. The source of the toxin 
or its building blocks has not yet been identified, and pitohui researchers are having similar 
problems determining where the bird’s toxin originates from. It has been proposed that some 
forest plants produce precursors for these chemicals and use them as defensive chemicals to 
deter the chomping jaws of herbivorous insects. In an interesting twist of nature, the insects have 
turned the tables on the plants and, instead of being deterred, are actually able to incorporate the 
poisons into their own tissues, modifying them for their own needs and using them as weapons 
against their own predators. It is possible that the birds have done something similar and are 
capable of eating otherwise distasteful insects and using the toxins to defend themselves. In 
2004, it was found that choresine beetles, small, brightly colored tropical insects, contain BTX, 
and it is known that hooded pitohuis in the wild feed on a huge range of insects, some of which 
are known to be choresine beetles and their kin. This fascinating picture is not yet complete, and 
it may never be fully understood, such is the complexity of tropical ecosystems. 

♦ Six species of pitohui are known from the forests of New Guinea, and all of them 
can be found quite easily; some even frequent the forests around the capital of New 
Guinea, Port Moresby. 

♦ The rusty, black crested and variable pitohuis are also known to be poisonous, but 
only the latter species is on a par with the hooded variety, 

♦ It is possible the pitohuis are only poisonous for certain parts of the year. Perhaps, 
the dietary source of the BTX is not available all year-round. This and many other 
questions are yet to be answered. 

♦ In some parts of their range, the hooded pitohuis are so loaded with toxin that even 
handling them causes sneezing and watery eyes. 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


♦ Whatever the source of the bird’s toxin, it is undoubtedly used as defense to deter 
predators. The bird’s bold plumage is a warning sign to potential predators: “eat me 
and you will regret it!” As the hooded pitohui’s breast skin and feathers contain 

a lot of toxin, the eggs may be coated with the BTX when they are being brooded 
in the nest. The forests of New Guinea are home to many egg thieves, especially 
reptiles that specialize in nest raiding. A noxious coating would protect the vulnerable 
eggs, thereby allowing the parents to forage for food. 

♦ The New Guinea people call the pitohuis rubbish birds as they are not good for 
eating. In desperate times they can be eaten, but the feathers and skin have to be 
removed before the flesh is coated with charcoal and then roasted. 

♦ After the pitohui’s toxic nature was discovered, another New Guinea bird, the 
blue-capped ifrita was also found to contain high levels of BTX. The local people of 
New Guinea call the ifrita the nanisani, which is the name they give to the tingling, 
numbing feeling a person feels if they put their fingers in their mouth after touching 
one of these birds. The name nanisani is also used for the blue and orange choresine 
beetles, as they cause the same sensation. 

♦ In the swampy lowlands of New Guinea, large flocks of several black and brown 
bird species are often led by a few members of the toxic pitohui species, suggesting a 
complex social arrangement between these birds. It is likely that the nonpoisonous 
birds are relying on the protection afforded by the pitohui’s bold plumage and toxins.

MIMIC OCTOPUS 



Mimic Octopus — A mimic octopus mimicking a flatfish on the seabed. (Mike Shanahan) 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Tbaumoctopus mimicus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Mollusca 
Class: Cephalopoda 
Order: Octopoda 
Family: Octopodidae 

What does it look like? Fully grown, this octopus has an arm span of around 60 cm. Its body 
is patterned with brown and white stripes and spots. 

Where does it live? The distribution of the mimic octopus seems to be restricted to the 
Indo-Malaysian archipelago. It is found in water 2-12 m deep, often near the mouths of 
rivers where the seabed is silty or sandy, 

A Master of Disguise 

The camouflage abilities of octopuses and their relatives, the squids and cuttlefish, are second to 
none as they are able to quickly change their color to blend in with their background. One spe- 
cies, the mimic octopus, is the undisputed king when it comes to disguise. Not only can it change 
its color as and when it needs to, but it can also use its flexible body to adopt the appearance and 
movements of a variety of sea creatures. 

In its normal foraging guise, the octopus inches along the seabed searching for suitable prey, 
exploring tunnels and burrows with its long, sensitive arms. Any crustaceans, worms, or small 
fish quaking in the burrows will try to swim for safety, only to be ensnared by the webbing be- 
tween the upper parts of the octopus’s arms. 

Although the mimic octopus is a predator, the bare, silty seabed is a dangerous place for a 
large, soft-bodied animal. Predators abound, and many could easily make short work of this 
master of disguise. Should the octopus spy danger, it draws its arms into a leaflike shape, changes 
color to match the seabed, and swims off with undulations of its body. The posture, color, and 
particularly the movement are startlingly similar to a number of flatfish found in the same area. 
These flatfish have venom glands at the base of their dorsal and anal fins, and many predators 
give them a wide berth. 

In situations when the predator isn’t fooled by the old flatfish trick, it swims up from the seabed 
and splays its arms wide. Cruising slowly through the water in this posture, it looks for all intents 
and purposes like a lionfish brandishing its venomous spines. The approaching predator has dealt 
with lionfish before, knowing their stings to be particularly painful, so it swims off and searches for 
easier pickings. The mimic octopus continues on its foraging rounds and then accidentally swims 
through the breeding ground of a damselfish, which happens to be fiercely territorial. The fish 
doesn’t take kindly to this intruder, and it goes on the offensive. With an angry damselfish bearing 
down on it, the octopus uses yet another of its impersonations and makes for the nearest hole. It 
changes color and pattern and sticks six of its arms into the hole, leaving two at the surface heading 
off in different directions, waving sinuously in the water. Hey presto — a convincing impersonation 
of a banded sea snake, an animal that will quite happily eat a damselfish. The aggressive fish gets 
the message and backs off. 

As splendid as these impersonations are, they are not the octopus’s entire repertoire. Some 
predators may be invulnerable to the poisonous spines of flatfish and lionfish and unfazed by the 
venomous bite of a sea snake. In these circumstances, the octopus may swim to the surface, fully 
extend its many arms, and float slowly back toward the seabed in much the same way as certain 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


jellyfish found in the same waters. Even if the stinging cells of a large jellyfish are not enough to 
deter some hungry predators, the octopus takes to the seafloor, and on a mound of silt, it raises 
its arms above its body to give a very convincing impression of a large, stinging anemone, 

♦ The mimic octopus was only officially discovered in 1998, and its amazing repertoire 
of impersonations was only discovered in 2001. 

♦ Although octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish are probably the most adept camouflage 
artists in the animal kingdom, mimicry appears to be very rare. In most cases, blending 
into the background may be a far more effective defensive tactic than trying to look like 
something else, especially if the impersonation is a poor one. Many species of octopus 
live in areas where there are numerous places to conceal themselves, such as reefs or 
the rocky seabed. Should they find themselves caught short in the open, they can 
change color in the blink of an eye to match their backdrop. The mimic octopus does 
not have this option. It lives in a habitat where cover is in short supply, so the ability to 
impersonate a number of dangerous neighbors is a very desirable trait. It is likely that 
the octopus picks its disguise, depending on the threat. Very few animals can do this to 
the same extent as the mimic octopus, 

♦ Color changing in octopuses is made possible by specialized skin cells called 
chromatophotophores. These cells can be stretched and squeezed by muscles around 
their perimeter. When the muscles contract, the cell is drawn out into a large, flat plate. 
In this state, the pigment in the cell covers a large area. When the muscles relax, the 
cell contracts, and the pigment spot is much less obvious to the observer. The pigment 
in these cells may be yellow, orange, red, blue, or black. All of these colors may occur 

in groups or layers. The visual effect of these color cells is enhanced by underlying 
reflective layers called iridocytes, which vary the shade and the tone of the color directed 
toward the observer. With this elegant system ,the animal can communicate with 
a riotous display of shimmering colors or blend into the background. 

♦ The mimic octopus is also the only known octopus species that traverses tunnels and 
burrows to conceal itself from predators and to search for food. When surveying its 
surroundings, it may adopt a sentinel posture in a suitable burrow entrance with only 
its eyes and head sticking out of the hole. 

♦ The octopuses and their kin are, arguably, the pinnacle of invertebrate evolution. 

Their sophisticated anatomy, complex behavior, and learning abilities distinguish 
them from the vast majority of other invertebrates. Although they are familiar to 
everyone, there is great deal still to learn about these fascinating animals.

SEA CUCUMBERS 

Scientific name: Holothurian 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Echinoderma 
Class: Holothuroidea 
Order: various 
Family: various 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Sea Cucumbers — A sea cucumber rupturing its 
body and ensnaring a hungry crab in its sticky in- 
ternal organs, (Mike Shanahan) 



Sea Cucumbers — A sea cucumber lying on the sea- 
bed in the Caribbean. (Bart Hazes) 


What do they look like? Sea cucumbers range from spherical animals to wormlike creatures. 
The smallest are less than 3 cm in length, while the largest can be more than 1 m long with 
a diameter of 24 cm. Most of the common species are between 10 and 30 cm in length. 

At the front end, there is a crown of tentacles surrounding the mouth. The underside of 
the body bears small, flexible structures known as tube feet. Their colors are normally quite 
drab, including black, brown, and olive green, although some species can have bold colors 
and patterns. 

Where do they live? The sea cucumbers are exclusively marine and can be found in almost 
every oceanic environment, including shoreline habitats and the deepest oceanic trenches. 
They are at their most diverse in the shallow water of tropical coral reefs. 

Pop Yourself to Protect Yourself 

Most people would be hard pressed to identify a sea cucumber as an animal even if it was held 
under their nose. Superficially, they look like some sort of exotic root vegetable. They have none 
of the normal features we associate with animals. Where are the limbs, the eyes, or the ears? 
They have none of these. Nonetheless, they are animals, and they certainly rank very highly 
in the bizarre charts. Sea cucumbers are unassuming creatures. They mill around very slowly 
in their marine habitats using their tentacles to transfer edible matter from the seabed to their 
mouth. To give an idea of how sluggish these animals are, a large specimen will be rushed off its 
countless tube feet if it manages to cover 4 m in 24 hours. Many species are far more movement 
averse than this. They simply find a suitable crevice and wriggle their way in. As they are large 
soft-bodied animals severely lacking in anything like a burst of speed, evolution has been very 
imaginative in dreaming up a range of defenses for them. 

Most sea cucumbers rely on hiding. A hefty sea cucumber can squeeze in through a very 
tight gap, and it can do this thanks to the unique connective tissue beneath its skin. This catch 
collagen as it is known can be loosened and tightened at will. When the animal wants to slip 
through a small gap, it can essentially liquefy its body and pour into the space. To keep itself 
safe in these crevices and cracks, the sea cucumber hooks up all its collagen fibers, making its 
extraction a challenge for even the most determined predator. 

This is one way the sea cucumbers can defend themselves, but it is far from the most 
impressive in their collection. Most species of sea cucumber, if they feel threatened or stressed, 
can voluntarily explode, spraying a potential aggressor with their internal organs. During these 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


defensive explosions, the body can pop at the front or rear, and the sea cucumber’s enemy will get 
a face full of sticky gunk. What may seem like quite a drastic measure does the sea cucumber no 
lasting harm. Its tattered body regenerates, and all the missing organs are replaced. If this is not 
enough, some sea cucumbers have yet another tactic. Within their body they have a number of 
thin tubules, and when the animal is threatened, it ruptures its own anus, and the tubules stream 
out of the body. They are very sticky, and on contact with sea water, they expand to many times 
their original size. For a hungry crab, getting ensnared in these sticky bindings may be the last 
thing it ever does. The finishing touch to this anal explosion is the release of a toxic chemical 
called holotburin, which has similar properties to soap. Like a miniature chemical explosion, the 
holothurin can kill any animals in the immediate vicinity that are unable to escape. 

♦ There are around 900 species of sea cucumber in the world’s oceans, and like their rela- 
tives, the starfish, brittle stars, urchins, and crinoids, they are very ancient animals, with 
a fossil history extending back at least 400 million years. Because many sea cucumbers 
live at great depths, it is very likely many more species are yet to be identified. 

♦ Sea cucumbers are also unusual in the way they breathe. They don’t have the normal 
gill-like structures that are normally found in marine animals. Oxygen is obtained, 
and carbon dioxide discarded through the anus. Delicate organs, called respiratory 
trees, sprout from near the animal’s anus taking up a good proportion of the inter- 
nal body space. The pulsating rear end of the animal slowly fills and empties these 
channels like a gentle pump. 

♦ Like any nook in the ocean, the respiratory trees of the sea cucumber make excellent 
dwellings, and a little fish, the pearl fish, spends its time, when it isn’t foraging, inside 
the sea cucumber. It is not known if the sea cucumber gets anything in return for 
supplying the fish with a safe place to live, but the fish cannot come and go with 
carefree ease. It can only sneak into the respiratory trees when the sea cucumber 
opens its anus — then, tail first, it darts for the hole. It is believed that some species of 
pearl fish may actually be parasitic on sea cucumbers, feeding on their internal organs 
after gaining access to the respiratory trees, 

♦ In many parts of the world, the cooked and dried body wall of certain sea cucumbers is 
used to make trepang and beche-de-mer, a flavorsome delicacy. Fishermen use the toxins 
produced by sea cucumbers to stupefy fish and lure them from their refuges in coral 
reefs. The sticky, defensive tubules of some species are also used to make improvised 
bandages. More recently, the numerous chemicals produced by sea cucumbers have 
attracted the attention of pharmaceutical companies, as some of these compounds show 
promise as antimicrobial, anticoagulant, and anti-inflammatory medicines. 

SLOW LORIS 

Scientific name: Nycticebus coucang 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Primates 
Family: Lorisidae 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Slow Loris — A slow loris licking at the elbow skin that produces a defensive secretion. (Mike Shanahan) 


What does it look like? The slow loris is a medium-sized primate. The body is around 
30 cm long, while the tail is reduced to a mere stump of no more than 5 cm in length. 
When fully grown, they can weigh up to 2 kg. The short, dense fur is variable in color 
but is typically of an ash-gray hue, A dark dorsal line divides the fur on the head into two 
branches, which surround the eyes. Their limbs are long and powerful, and their tiny hands 
have well-developed thumbs. The front-facing eyes are very large, and the ears are almost 
concealed amid its fur. 

Where does it live? The slow loris and its numerous subspecies are found from Bangladesh 
to Vietnam. They are arboreal animals, preferring the tops of tress in forested areas. 

When a Bark Is Nothing Compared to the Bite 

The slender loris is a comical, timid creature. The word loris is actually Dutch for “clown,” whereas 
the Indonesian name malu-malu can be translated as “shy one,” The appearance and slow, exact 
movements of this primate give the impression of a very cuddly and docile creature. They move 
with extreme caution along the branches of their arboreal home, surveying their territory and 
looking for tasty morsels to eat. 

Appearances in nature can be deceptive, and this is especially true for the slow loris. This 
vulnerable-looking little primate is more than capable of looking after itself and has some unique 
adaptations to deter even the fiercest predator. Should a slow loris be confronted by an arboreal 
predator, such as a civet, it stops in its already slow tracks and remains motionless. The circulatory 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


system of the hands and feet allows the primate to grip for many hours without losing sensation. 
If this simple trick doesn’t dupe the interested predator, the slow loris will fold its arms over its 
head in a way that makes its look as though it is holding its ears. It then laps at the skin on the 
inside of its elbow, the so-called branchial region. The secretions produced by the glands in this 
area actually become toxic when they are taken into the mouth and mixed with saliva. Should 
the predator approach within striking distance, the slow loris will lunge at the aggressor with 
surprising speed in an attempt to bite it. The teeth of the slow loris are a savage looking affair, and 
its jaws muscles are very strong. The long and pointed canines can deliver a very nasty bite, while 
the smaller teeth at the very front of the jaw deliver a cocktail of toxin and saliva to the wound. 
The bites are particularly painful as human victims can vouch for, and the activated toxin can 
cause allergic reactions in humans, which can cause death. 

The slow loris’s unique means of defending itself can also be adapted to protect its young. 
A female loris, feeling the need to forage, will leave her young gripping onto a branch, but before 
she leaves it to find food, she mixes her elbow secretions with her saliva and coats the youngster 
with it. Any opportunistic predators that try to snatch the baby loris will be left feeling sick with 
a bad taste in their mouth. The pungent odor of the elbow secretions, which is likened to sweaty 
socks, may also act as a deterrent, keeping all but the hungriest predators at bay. 

♦ The slow loris, the slender loris of Sri Lanka, the pottos, the bush babies, and the 
lemurs are all known as wet-nosed primates. They are related to the more well-known 
primates, the monkeys and apes, but the two groups first went their own evolutionary 
way millions of years ago, 

♦ The eyes of the slow loris are huge. Each one weighs about 3 g, which is a lot more 
than the brain of the animal. They are so big that they cannot move within their 
orbits, and so the only way the loris can shift its gaze is by moving its head. 

♦ Due to their appearance, the slow loris and the slender loris are often taken from 
the wild to be kept as pets. They are easily frightened and will bite and scratch when 
afraid. Unfortunate owners soon learn that these charming-looking creatures are 
more than a handful. They cannot be tamed, and as they require warm conditions 
and specific types of food, they don’t last very long as house pets, 

♦ The lorises are carnivores, and in the wild, they catch and eat a wide variety of 
animal prey including invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, and possibly small birds and 
mammals. Their chameleon-like progress through the trees allows them to sneak up 
on unwary prey before making a fast and accurate lunge, 

♦ The thumbs of the slow loris are very opposable, much more so than our own. 

This provides a sure grip and enables them to clamber along even thin branches with 
remarkable ease, 

♦ They make a variety of sounds when communicating with one another and when 
alarmed. These calls range from buzzing growls to chirps and whistles, 

♦ The lorises and their relatives are rarely seen by humans in their native habitat. 

They are occasionally hunted and eaten, but the greatest threat to these fascinating 
primates is the destruction of their forest home.

SPRINGTAILS 



Springtails — A springtail avoids the jaws of a predatory beetle by using its springy furcula. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Collembola 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Entognatha 
Order: Collembola 
Family: various 

What do they look like? The springtails are very small animals. The largest are only around 
10 mm long, while the smallest are very tiny, measuring around 0.2 mm. They have three 
body parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. On the head is a pair of simple antenna and a 
pair of very simple eyes. Three pairs of shortish, simple legs sprout from the underside of 
the thorax. The long abdomen is composed of six segments, and at its end, there is structure 
known as th e furcula. The whole body of these minute animals is clothed in fine scales, 
which can sometimes be very brightly colored. 



THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 


Where do they live? The springtails are found all around the world in almost every 

conceivable habitat. 

Springing to a Great Escape 

Most people have probably seen a springtail. Whenever a large stone is lifted from its rest- 
ing place or when a log is rolled over, the small specks that jump all over the place are, in fact, 
springtails. Although commonly encountered living beneath debris, springtails actually dwell 
in a very wide variety of habitats. Some species can be found in the canopies of trees; others 
loiter beneath seaweed on the beach. There are springtails that live out their whole lives on the 
surface film of freshwater and salt water or in the parched, unforgiving deserts of Australia. 
There are even springtails that eek out a living in the frozen wastes of Antarctica. In the whole 
diverse world of the terrestrial creepy crawly, it is the springtails whose range reaches the far- 
thest south. In these inhospitable, frozen deserts, the springtails have to tolerate temperatures 
as low as — 60°C. Few other creatures can tolerate such extreme conditions. Not only are the 
springtails found all over the world, but they are found in huge numbers. It has been estimated 
that an average square meter of grassland or woodland is home to around 40,000 of these small 
animals, although in some areas, the number is more likely to be in the region of 200,000. In 
the tropics, a square meter of canopy habitat accommodates at least 150 species of springtail. 
The massive population densities of springtails make them a very important component in all 
terrestrial ecosystems. They feed on organic matter in the soil, including decaying plant and 
animal matter, fungal filaments, andjust about whatever detritus they can get their mouthparts 
into. Their feeding activities are crucial in the recycling process. The ceaseless, slow, almost 
imperceptible degradation of once-living tissue frees up nutrients for plant growth, the basis of 
all land-based food webs. Depending on the location, springtails can be responsible for around 
one-third of this recycling process. 

What contributes to the success of these minute, easily overlooked animals? First, their small 
size allows them to live in large numbers out of the gaze of potential predators. They can crawl in 
the small gaps and fissures in the soil, where larger animal can’t really get at them. They also have 
a range of defensive tactics to evade danger. The most impressive of these is their ability to jump 
high into the air at the slightest sign of danger. At their back end, they have a long thin structure, 
the furcula. This spring can be folded beneath the body, where it is held in place with a catchlike 
mechanism. Releasing the furcula propels the springtail upward with violent force. In a fraction 
of second, they can propel themselves many times their own body length. Their reflexes are 
similarly rapid, and some species can respond to the investigative probings of a predator in a 
smidgen over 18 milliseconds. The scales of the springtails are also an effective means of defense. 
A hungry beetle may try to grab the springtail in its powerful jaws, but all it ends up with is a 
mouthful of scales as the springtail leaps away to safety. Other springtails produce very noxious 
chemicals, which are more than enough to deter most potential predators. All in all, the combi- 
nation of small size, good defenses, and unfussy feeding habits make the springtails among the 
most successful animals on the planet, 

♦ Around 6,000 species of springtail are currently known, but it has been estimated 
that there could be more than 50,000 living species. They are the most widespread 
of all the six-legged creatures; their range encompasses all of the continents, even 
Antarctica, 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ It was presumed for a long time that the springtails represented the ancestors of the 
insects. They have six legs and three body parts, but that it seems is where the similarity 
ends. It appears that the ancestors of the insects and the modern springtails parted 
company a very long time ago, even before the forebears of insects and crustaceans 
took to their separate evolutionary paths. 

♦ The oldest-known six-legged arthropod is a springtail fossil from rocks in Scotland, some 
400 million years old. Springtails have even been found in amber more than 40 million 
years old. These entombed specimens do not differ that much from their descendents, 

♦ Those species of springtail that spend their lives in the complete darkness of 
subterranean and cave habitats have lost their pigmentation. They also lack eyes, 
which would be nothing more than an extravagance in perpetual darkness, 

♦ Some species of springtail form dense aggregations containing many millions of 
individuals. A swarm in Austria of dark-bodied springtails was so huge that local 
people called the fire brigade to deal with what they believed to be an oil spill. 

♦ Springtail jumps are haphazard to say the least, but there is one species of springtail 
that has small inflatable sacs on its antenna that exude a sticky secretion. When a 
series of jumps is careering out of control, the springtail can head-butt the ground 
and bring itself to a halt.

THE QUEST FOR FOOD 


ANT LIONS 



Ant Lions — An ant slips down the walls of an ant 
lion pit to the waiting larva. (Mike Shanahan) 



Ant lions — An adult ant lion, a very different look- 
ing animal compared with the ground-dwelling larva. 
(Ross Piper) 


Scientific name: many species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Neuroptera 
Family: Myrmeleontidae 

What do they look like? Adult ant lions look very much like dragonflies. They have very large, 
ornately patterned wings that fold over the body when the animal is at rest. The abdomen 
is long and slender and the legs are quite short, but sturdy. The eyes are very large and there 




EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


is a pair of short, elegantly curving antennae. The largest ant lions have a wingspan of more 
than 16 cm, while that of the smallest is a mere 2 cm. The heavy bodied larvae have well 
developed legs, a tapering neck, a great, fat body, and a broad head with curving mouthparts. 
They are normally pale with dark markings. 

Where do they live? Ant lions are found all over the world, with the exception of the polar 
regions. They are more diverse in warm, dry areas. In the United States, the largest number 
of species is found in the southwestern states. The larval habitat is warm, sheltered slopes, 
the ground beneath rocky overhangs and rocky or woody crevices. 

On the Slippery Slope to an Unpleasant End 

The handsome appearance of an adult ant lion is a stark contrast to the grotesque larva, but as 
with many insects, it is the rarely seen and ugly immature stage that is the most fascinating. After 
all, in insects with a larval stage, the adult is little more than a mating and dispersing machine. The 
larva’s responsibility is to eat and grow and it is the pursuit of food that has spawned such an array 
of sizes, shapes and behaviors. The larva of many ant lion species are simply sit and wait predators, 
patiently letting the hours or days role by with their huge, curved mouthparts cocked, ready for an 
insect to come within striking distance. Some species have taken this sit and wait technique a stage 
further and construct a conical pit in which to entrap prey. The young larva builds this trap by 
walking backwards in ever-decreasing circles, forming a small doodle in the sand or soft soil. As the 
circle gets smaller and smaller, the young ant lion gets deeper and deeper. Soon, a well formed pit 
has been made and the larva settles down at the bottom, almost completely obscured except, per- 
haps, for the tips of its impressive, pronged mouthparts. The places where these animals construct 
their traps are just the sort of places coveted by other insects, such as ants, for their warmth. An 
ant, scurrying across the sand, rushing back to its nest, may fail to notice the innocuous looking pit. 
It tumbles into the base of the trap, reorientates itself and attempts to walk up the smooth sides 
of the depression. No sooner has it started its ascent when grains of sand rain down on it. The 
ant lion larva at the bottom of its trap has detected the struggling prey and using flicks of its head, 
hurls sand at the unfortunate prey. This shower of sand creates miniature land slides in the walls of 
the pit and the prey slips slowly and steadily to the waiting jaws of its tormentor. The eating apparatus of 
the ant lion is unusual in that it has no distinct mouth, much like a spider. The contents of the prey have 
to be liquidized by the injection of powerful enzymes and then sucked up through a channel formed by 
the snug fit of the mouthparts. A liquid diet has an advantage in that there is minimal waste and what 
left over matter there is accumulates in the larva for it has no anus to get rid of it from anyway. 

After as long as three years in its pit, growing fat on insect victims the larva is ready to pupate. 
It spins itself a silken cocoon using some of the waste matter, accumulated in its gut and goes 
through the body altering process of metamorphosis. After a month the adult hatches, empties 
its stomach of the remainder of the accumulated waste and struggles to the surface. It climbs the 
nearest perch and inflates its body and wings with air, waiting for its outer surface to harden and 
become air worthy. In around 20 minutes everything is ready, and the adult insect flutters off on 
its maiden flight, completely unrecognizable as a formidable, miniature sand monster. 

♦ There are around 2,000 species of ant lion distributed around the world. The largest 
species are found in Africa and Madagascar. They are related to the lacewings and 
dobsonflies. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 63 


♦ Ant lions, especially the species 
forming pits are sometimes 
known as doodlebugs for their 
habitat of tracing a path in sand 
or loose earth when they are 
constructing a trap, just like a 
little doodle. 

♦ Adult ant lions live for little over 
a month. This is just enough 
time to mate and for the females 
to deposit her eggs in ground 
suitable for her offspring. 

♦ In suitable areas, the ground will 
be pitted with the traps of ant 
lion larva, undoubtedly a gauntlet 
for any small, ground dwelling 
invertebrates, 

♦ Adult ant lions are weak flyers 
and many are nocturnal. Despite 
their poor aeronautical skills 
they are predatory and will catch 
smaller insects on the wing. They 
will also eat pollen.

AYE- AYE 

Scientific name: Daubentonia madagascariensis 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Primates 
Family: Daubentoniidae 

What does it look like? This is the largest of the nocturnal primates. They can grow to 

30-37 cm from head to body, with a long tail measuring between 44 and 53 cm. They weigh 
approximately 2,5 kg when fully grown. It is a rather shaggy looking beast with long black 
fur grizzled with white and grey. It has an odd head with large luminous eyes and a large 
pair of cuplike ears. The head is carried on a monkey-like body. 

Where does it live? The aye-aye is found only in Madagascar. It is an arboreal animal and is 
found in the forests on the eastern fringe of the country. It is limited to the northern parts of 
the island. 


^ Go Look! 

In the United States the only species of ant lion to make 
the little, conical pits is Myrmeleon immaculatus. This 
is the archetypal doodlebug and it can be found in large 
populations throughout the eastern and southern states. 
They can be found in sandy, sheltered habitats, such as 
blowouts in grassland or dune areas, vacant lots and 
scrub. The pits of the larvae will be immediately obvi- 
ous if you are in the right place. You can either watch 
the larvae in their natural setting by tossing them a small 
insect or two, or you can carefully dig out the animal 
and take it home where it can easily be kept in a suitably 
sized contained part filled with sand. Take a look at their 
unusual, almost grotesque appearance, particularly their 
impressive jaws. The young ant lion will require feed- 
ing, but they will eat almost any small ground dwelling 
creepy crawly. Watch the sand flicking behavior to bring 
the prey within range of the fearsome jaws. When they 
no longer pay an interest in food, the larvae may be pu- 
pating. Now is the time to insert a stick into the sand and 
surround the container with a sleeve of light mesh or net, 
closed at the top to prevent the escape of the adult. After 
three weeks to a month, the adult will emerge and haul 
out of the sand before climbing the stick to harden and 
inflate its body. The adult can then be returned to the 
wild where it will feed and mate.

EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Aye-Aye — An aye-aye uses its long finger to probe a hole in a tree for juicy grubs. (Mike Shanahan) 


Long Digits Make Light Work 

The disappearing forests of Madagascar are home to a myriad of strange mammals, one of which 
is the aye-aye. This peculiar creature mystified zoologists for years as they could not decide what 
it was. Its head and teeth are rodent-like, and for a long time it was thought to be some manner of 
giant squirrel. Eventually people realized it was a primate, but it took even more time for people to 
realize how much of an oddity it was. Perhaps its strangest feature is its hands. The middle finger 
on each hand is thin and bony and up to three times longer than the other fingers. These modified 
fingers are the aye-aye’s feeding tools. At night, anywhere between 30 minutes and 3 hours after 
sunset, the aye-aye leaves its daytime hidey-hole of a nest built in the large fork of a tree. It leaps 
and clambers from branch to branch with acrobatic ease, its highly sensitive ears moving to and 
fro, listening for the slightest rustle or stirring that may indicate danger, or the movements of its 
dinner. It leaps to a branch and homes in on a vanishingly faint scraping coming from within the 
tree. To confirm its initial suspicions, the primate taps the wood and listens in much the same way 
as a builder finds cavities in a wall. A distinct hollow sound gives a positive answer to its hunch. 
Using its large incisors the aye-aye scrapes away the surface bark eventually revealing what seems 
to be a tunnel. Somewhere in the depths of the branch there is a juicy beetle grub happily gnaw- 
ing its way through the wood oblivious to the imminent danger. The aye-aye brings its so-called 
witch’s finger into play and probes the tunnel. The finger is thin and mobile, and like a delicate 
tool, it can tease the plump grub from its tunnel into the waiting maw of the expectant aye-aye. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 65 


The aye-aye is a lemur. The lemurs are a specific type of primate found only on the 
island of Madagascar. There are 52 living species, although several of the larger 
species have become extinct due to loss of habitat and hunting. The larger species of 
lemur are diurnal, while the smaller ones are mostly active during the night. 

The aye -aye is by far the most bizarre lemur. 

There are no woodpeckers in Madagascar, leaving a space in the ecological web for 
a creature capable of penetrating wood and capturing the larvae of wood boring 
insects. Behold the aye-aye! Instead of large teeth for gnawing and a bony digit for 
probing the woodpecker has a sharp beak for hammering and a long tongue for 
grabbing larvae. 

The teeth of the aye-aye are what most confused early naturalists. They grow 
throughout the life of the animal, like those of a rodent. They must grow continu- 
ously as the animal is a feverish gnawer of bark and wood. 

Apart from their genitals and their weight, male and female aye -ayes show no sexual 
dimorphism. 

Even a newborn aye-aye has excellent climbing and clinging abilities, which is a must 
when you emerge into the world 10 m above the ground. 

An aye-aye nest is not used permanently. Every few days an individual will build a 
new one in another large tree fork. 

Unlike some other lemurs the aye-aye is predominantly solitary. They only come 
together purposefully to breed and for the rest of the time they treat each other with 
disdain. Males protect territories and interlopers in these territories will be met with 
a frosty reception. 

All lemurs are regarded with derision by the natives of Madagascar who share 
their forest home. They are thought to be evil omens and harbingers of doom. 

There are a few rare exceptions to these widespread superstitions and some tribes 
actually believe the lemurs to be bringers of good. Unsurprisingly, the appearance 
and behavior of the aye-aye afford it the lion’s share of these ill feelings. It is said by 
some tribes that if an aye-aye points at you with it elongate middle finger you are 
certain to die very soon. People of the Saklava tribe claim the furtive and evil aye-aye 
will enter a hut and kill the occupants by puncturing the arteries in the chest using 
its spindly finger. Due to this very unfortunate bad press, the aye-aye is often killed 
on sight, even though it is a completely harmless, yet fascinating creature of the 
night. 

The aye-aye is one of the many animals and plants that are threatened by the 
habitat destruction that continues in Madagascar at an alarming rate. In 1985, only 
34 percent of the islands original forest cover remained and only 6 percent of this 
was protected. Even today, in these more conservation aware times, Madagascar’s 
wildlife is still under extreme threat. This pressing situation is made even more 
desperate by the fact that much of Madagascar’s flora and fauna is unique. The 
chunk of land that today forms the island split from the continent of Africa many 
millions of year ago. The life it carried with it evolved in isolation forming a selec- 
tion of unique species.

BOLAS SPIDERS 



Bolas Spiders— A female bolas spider catches a Bolas Spiders— An adult female bolas spider pho- 
moth with its minimalist, but ingenious web. (Mike tographed in daytime pose where she mimics a bird

Scientific name: Mastophora species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Araneidae 

What do they look like? The bolas spiders are typical orb web weavers. The females have 
a large, globular abdomen that is normally white and patterned with darker colors. The 
carapace is small and of a dark color. The male is much smaller than the female, with an 
abdomen that is in proportion to the rest of its body. 

Where do they live? Bolas spiders are found around the world, but no species are found 
in Europe. They are found in a range of different habitats, although they all require tall 
vegetation to catch their prey from. 

A Deceiving Arachnid with an Accurate Aim 

By day, the female bolas spider sits motionless on a leaf or branch. When night falls, the spider 
prepares to hunt, but unlike other related spiders, the web of the bolas spider is very minimal 
indeed. First she trails a horizontal, nonsticky thread of silk on the underside of a twig or leaf. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 67 


Suspended from this support line by two of her legs she then extrudes another silk thread 
about 2.5 cm in length. This second thread is sticky and the free end of it is finished off with a 
very sticky blob of silk. This second thread is the bolas. This is the full extent of her web and 
with it complete she dangles by a couple of her free legs from the support line, while one of 
the front legs supports the bolas. She will hang there, motionless, for 15 minutes and if no 
potential prey presents itself she will reel in the bolas and eat it. It is possible the female does 
this because the bolas has lost its stickiness. However, unperturbed, she makes another bolas 
and adopts the same posture. This time she hears the familiar sound of fluttering moth wings. 
During the first few hours of the night, cutworm moths are active, the caterpillars of which are 
crop pests. The spider has very poor eyesight, but it is the flapping of moth wings she has been 
waiting for. As the moth approaches, the spider uses her front leg to twirl the bolas. Interest- 
ingly, the moth appears to be drawn to the spider and as it flies past it gets slapped with the 
bolas and is stuck fast to the sticky globule at the end of the spider’s snare. Trapped, the moth 
is reeled in and the spider begins to feed. It has recently been discovered the spider can emit 
a pheromone mimicking the scent of a female cutworm moth. This odor lures male cutworm 
moths within range of the bolas. 

When she has finished her meal the spider may spin another bolas and try her luck for more 
cutworm moths. This busy early evening schedule is topped off with a rest before the late eve- 
ning session begins. At around midnight, other moth species, particularly the smoky tetanolita 
are on the wing and the sound of their flight triggers the spider into action once more, so she sets 
about spinning another bolas. The process is the same as before with the moth being drawn to 
the spider and then becoming ensnared in the whirling bolas. It is thought the two moth species 
have very similar sex pheromones, but they happen to be active at different times of the night. 
The bolas spider with its hunting strategy can target both moth species over the period of one 
night, simply by whirling its bolas when both moths are active. 


♦ There are several species of spider around the world that use a bolas to trap prey. 
There are species in both North and South America and in other parts of the world, 
such as Australia. This suggests the bizarre bolas strategy evolved on a number of 
occasions. 

♦ When at rest, the adult female bolas spider looks remarkably like a bird dropping, 
thanks to its large, globular abdomen and brownish carapace. This is a form of 
defensive mimicry as the animals that prey on succulent spiders pay very little 
attention to bird droppings. 

♦ Web building amongst spiders has it roots in the burrows constructed by the 
primitive spiders, which often have silken threads radiating out from the burrow 
entrance to alert the spider inside to potential prey. Over time, this basic system 
would have been adapted into the amazing structures constructed by orb-web spiders 
we see today. In several groups of spiders the standard web design has evolved and 

is often reduced. The most extreme example of web reduction amongst the orb-web 
weavers is seen in the bolas spiders. 

♦ The term bolas refers to the ranching and hunting tool of South American gauchos 
and the eskimos, which consisted of a length of rope or leather with a weight at each 
end. The user whirled the bolas above his head before releasing it at the legs of cattle 
or game. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The feeding strategy used by the bolas spider is a form of aggressive mimicry. The 
spider mimics the smell of female moths to attract male moths so it can catch and eat 
them. There are many examples of aggressive mimicry in the animal kingdom. A well 
known one is the anglerfish, where the first spine of the dorsal fin is greatly modified 
with its tip resembling a small worm. 

♦ Juvenile bolas spiders do not construct the snare of the adults, but they are able to 
produce pheromones to attract small flies, which they can pounce on. They normally 
do this by lurking on the lower side of a leaf near its edge. They wait until the fly 
approaches along the edge of the leaf before pouncing.

BULLDOG BAT 

Scientific name: Noctilio leporinus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Chiroptera 
Family: Noctilionidae 

What does it look like? In terms of looks, the bulldog bat leaves a lot to be desired. Its wrinkled, 
pink, puglike nose makes it look as though it has been involved in an accident. Its small, beady 
eyes are situated beneath a pair of large, pointy ears and the membrane forming its wings is 
thin enough to show the immensely lengthened digits that form the scaffold of its flying struc- 
tures, Its back bears a reddish-grey fur, while its underside is silvery grey. Its feet are large with 
sharp, curved claws. The toes and the claws of the bulldog bat are flattened from side-to-side, 
reducing the drag as they are trawled through the water. It is a small mammal with a body 
length of around 10 cm and a weight of only 70 g. Its wingspan is around 30 cm. 

Where does it live? The bulldog bat is found in Central and South America from Mexico all 
the way down to Argentina. There are also populations in Trinidad and the Antilles, Its 
preferred habitats are forests and mangrove swamps where it frequents sheltered pools, slow 
moving rivers and sheltered coastal lagoons. Occasionally, it is seen over open water, 

A Lesson in Fishing on the Wing 

During the day the bulldog bat sleeps, grooms and washes itself in a suitable hideaway, such as 
a tree hole, or a rocky cleft. A good roosting site is hard to find and is often used by many bats. 
With the setting of the sun, the bats become restless and prepare for the night’s activities. They 
leave the safety of the roosts and make for their hunting grounds. Pools, lakes and slow moving 
rivers are the bats favored places to find food. They crisscross the water, only illuminated by the 
moon and stars, using their power of echolocation to detect the faintest ripples on the water’s 
surface that may betray the presence of fish below. The bat produces pulses of ultrasound that

Bulldog Bat — A bulldog bat keeps a good grip on Bulldog Bat — A bulldog bat dangling from a branch, 

the fish it has just caught with its trawling claws, clearly showing its wide, long-clawed trawling feet. 

(Mike Shanahan) (Phil Myers) 


are emitted from the nose and directed and focused by the complex, convoluted skin of the nose, 
which gives the animal such a grotesque appearance. These pulses of sound bounce off whatever 
they are aimed at and it these echoes that the bat uses to build a picture of its surroundings. It is 
seeing’ with sound. As soon as it detects some ripples it descends to the waters surface and dips 
its feet in so that its long, curved claws are trawling approximately 2 or 3 cm below the surface. 
With its fishing hooks in the water, the bat makes a sweep of 30 cm to 3 m before ascending and 
turning to make a return sweep. The second time, the bat’s claws make contact with a slippery 
fish and before the prey can react the bat scoops it from the water and straight to its jaws, which 
bristle with needle-like teeth. It makes for a suitable perch and dangles from its claws to feed on 
the fish. It first chews the fish to break it into large pieces, which are then transferred to cheek 
pouches to be chewed again before finally being swallowed. The bat is a small mammal with a 
fast metabolic rate that requires a lot of food, so as soon as the first meal of the night has been 
ingested the bat takes to the air again and continues trawling the water. In a single night the bat 
may catch and eat 20-30 small fish. 

♦ Bats are a very diverse group of mammals. At least one in every five mammal species 
is a bat. There are two, distinct types of bat, the microbats (microchiroptera) and 
the megabats (megachiroptera — flying foxes, fruit bats). Although the two groups 
look quite similar, their relationship is complex. The fossil record of bats is very 
poor, making it very difficult to understand their ancestry. It was once thought the 
microchiroptera evolved from an insectivorous mammal, while the megchiroptera 


EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


were once believed to have descended from a primitive, primate-like mammal, but this 
has largely been discredited. 

♦ There are other mammals that can glide using membranes of skin, but the bats are the 
only mammals with functional wings that can be flapped. The thin membrane of the 
bat wing allows the bones to be clearly seen. The wing is just a modified limb with an 
elongated forearm and ridiculously long digits, 

♦ Bats, particularly the microchiroptera are much maligned by humans due to their 
nocturnal activities, unsavory appearance and predilection for living in caves and 
other dark corners. The study of bats has helped to dispel many of the myths asso- 
ciated with them. In 1793, the Italian, Lazzaro Spallanzani, showed that a blinded 
bat could still hunt effectively, but one that could not hear was disorientated. This 
was the first real indication of echolocation. It wasn’t until 145 years later that 
sensitive microphones were developed that allowed the American, Donald Grif- 
fin, to listen in on the ultrasonic sound pulses produced by bats. Humans can hear 
sounds with frequencies of between 20 and 20,000 Hz. Any sound above this range 
is known as ultrasonic and bats are sensitive to a range of less than 100 Hz up to 
200,000 Hz. These rapid, high-pitched clicks are used to navigate and find food in 
the dark. Even in the pitch dark of a cave, the bat has little trouble finding its way. 
This fantastic adaptation is one reason for their success, 

♦ The majority of bats are predatory, although the larger flying foxes and some of the 
smaller bats are herbivorous and feed mainly on fruit and nectar. The predatory 
microchiroptera hunt mainly nocturnal insects. Moths are a favorite snack, and bats 
have been hunting them for so long that they grown wise to the tactics used by these 
nighttime hunters. Some moths are able to hear the distinctive hunting sound pulses 
produced by an approaching bat and go into an evasive dive just before the bat strikes, 

♦ Where they occur, bats are incredibly important components of the ecosystem. They 
not only consume huge numbers of insects every night, but in the tropics they are also 
responsible for the pollination and seed dispersal of many hundreds of plant species, 

♦ In many western societies the bat is associated with evil, yet in many countries, such 
as China bats are associated with longevity and happiness. 

♦ With a body length of 2.9-3.3 cm and tipping the scales at 1.5-2 g, Kitti’s hog-nosed 
bat is probably the smallest mammal in the world. It is about the size of a big bumble- 
bee and was only discovered in 1974. Like many bat species it is critically endangered.

CANDIRU 

Scientific name: Vandellia cirrhosa 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Siluriformes 
Family: Trichomycteridae 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD

Candiru — A candirii slips under the gill cover 
of a larger, Amazonian fish. (Mike Shanahan) 



Candiru — An adult candiru after a blood meal, show- 
ing its distended belly. (Ivan Sazima) 


What does it look like? Candirus are small fish. Adults grow to only 15 cm with a rather 
small head and a belly that can appear distended, especially after a heavy meal. The body is 
also rather translucent making it quite difficult to see in the water. There are short, sensory 
barbels around the head, together with short backward pointing spines on the gill covers. 
Where does it live? The candiru is native to South America where it can be found in the slow 
flowing waters of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers and their tributaries. 

Reaching the Parts Other Fish Cannot Reach 

Few animals are shrouded in as much myth and fable as the candiru fish. For many years, travelers 
to the Amazon have told stories of a fish with some very grisly habits. Stories aside, the candiru 
is a very interesting fish. It is one of the only known, wholly parasitic vertebrates. It depends on 
other living animals, normally bigger fish, for its sustenance. In the cloudy, sluggish waters of 
the lower Amazon, the candiru spends much of its time, on or near the bottom. The water is 
permeated by a whole range of different odors. Some emanate from decaying matter littering the 
river bottom, while others drift from the bodies of living animals. Tiny molecules of ammonia in 
bodily fluids find their way into the candirus nostrils. To this small fish these odors are the nasal 
equivalent of a dinner bell. It follows the trail of molecules to its source, which turns out to be a 
hefty Amazonian river fish, many times the size of the candiru. Not wanting to alarm its quarry 
the candiru swims tentatively up to the area behind the head, where the large gill covers open 
and close circulating water to the fish’s breathing structures. As the gill covers open the candiru 
seizes its moment and darts under, into the big fish’s gill cavity. The candiru sinks its jaws into 
the blood rich tissues of the gills and feeds on the flesh and blood. The big fish is powerless. It 
must simply bear what surely must be a very painful experience as the little parasitic candiru 
gnaws its gills. The host’s torment will only cease when the candiru has a full belly and slips from 
beneath the gill covers to rest on the river bed where it will digest its meal. 

This is the candirus natural behavior, but the local people of the Amazon and those who have 
heard stories tell of a different behavior guaranteed to send a shiver through the spine of even 
the most hardened river bather. In the same way the candiru finds its normal quarry, it may 
follow scent trails to find a person at the end of it instead of a big fish. Urea in the person’s urine 
is thought to be what gets the candirus nostrils twitching, but instead of a gill cover to swim 
beneath, it finds the urethra, the tube from which urine is passed, or perhaps the anus, and darts 
right up, in to the darkness. It feeds on the soft tissues until replete or until the victim’s protestations 


EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


force it to question its choice of quarry. Unfortunately, the passages it swam up are a tight fit and 
if it tries to back out, the backward pointing spines on its body keep it fixed in place. This is how 
the stories go at least and up until rather recently this is all they were, stories. However, an unfor- 
tunate man in Brazil was bathing in the river and decided he needed to urinate. No sooner had 
he started to relieve himself than a candiru shot straight up his urethra. A surgeon in the nearby 
city of Manaus had to operate on the man to dislodge the fish from within his penis. So, it seems 
there is some truth in the legends surrounding the candiru. 

♦ The candiru is a type of pencil catfish of which there are more than 180 species. In 
actual fact, the huge expanse of the Amazon basin with its huge variety of freshwater 
habitats is home to at least 700 species of freshwater fish. Undoubtedly, the cloudy 
waters and huge expanses of impenetrable waterways of the Amazon make this a 
haven for many more fish that are, as yet, unknown to science, 

♦ Several, very similar species of pencil catfish may have the same parasitic behavior as 
the candiru. 

♦ Apart from the name candiru, the fish is also known as the carnero, canero, or vam- 
pire catfish. 

♦ The candiru, like its relatives shuns the light and burrows in to the mud and silt of the 
river bed, only emerging to feed and find a mate. The other species in this family feed 
on small invertebrates they find in the river detritus, 

♦ Locals know of the candirus tendencies so well that there is apparently a herbal remedy 
for a well lodged candiru. The leaves of the jagua plant ( Genipa americana) and the fruit 
of another Amazonian plant are combined to make a preparation inserted into where the 
fish has lodged itself. The active ingredients in the plants, which are very acidic, allegedly 
dissolve the body of the fish. This miracle cure has not been investigated, so it is difficult 
to know whether it is true. It is also said that this preparation can be used to dissolve 
kidney stones. The chances of a candiru entering the penis, vagina or rectum of a person 
are very slim indeed and it should be stressed only one documented case is known. 

♦ Apart from the grisly feeding behavior of the candiru very little is known about the 
rest of its life. This is also the case for the vast majority of Amazonian fish. Many are 
caught for eating, but there is scant information on what they do in the wild.

COMMON CHAMELEON 

Scientific name: Chamaeleo chamaeleon 
Scientific classification:

Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Chamaeleonidae 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 73 



Common Chameleon — A poised chameleon 
strikes at a resting insect with its amazing tongue. 
(Mike Shanahan) 



Common Chameleon — The grasping digits and 
highly mobile eyes of this lizard can be clearly seen 
in this photograph. (Martin Rejzek) 


What does it look like? The common chameleon is a medium sized lizard reaching lengths of 
around 60 cm, half of which is the prehensile tail that is held in a coil when not in use. The 
body of the chameleon is flattened from side to side, while on the feet there are five digits 
forming excellent claspers. The head of the chameleon is large with bony keels making it 
look as though it is wearing a helmet. The eyes are large, independently mobile and mounted 
in small turrets. The mouth is large and gives the animal a sort of cartoon look. 

Where does it live? The common chameleon is found around the Mediterranean as far north 
as the south of Spain and as far east as Israel. It prefers forested and wooded areas where it 
dwells in trees and bushes. 

When Only a Tongue Will Do 

The chameleon must rate as one of the most unusual and entertaining reptiles. It is a comical 
looking creature, yet its amusing appearance belies it effectiveness as a predator. The chameleon 
is a diurnal stalker of any insect or spider that shares it arboreal home. The digits are arranged 
on its feet so that it grips a branch with two claws on one side and three on the other, giving it 
secure purchase on even flimsy twigs. The tail is also prehensile and the tip is wrapped around 
the branch to act like a safety line. Haste means nothing to the chameleon. It is an animal of slow, 
measured strides. The eyes of the chameleon are perhaps the most peculiar among the vertebrates. 
They are mounted in what look like tiny turrets and it can move each one separately. When it 
is scanning the nearby vegetation for a potential meal they swivel in all directions, enabling the 
lizard to see all around without moving its head and alerting an unwary snack to its presence. 
The eyes, appearing to have a life of their own, do nothing to give the chameleon a serious, preda- 
tory look. However, when one of the constantly rolling eyes has spotted something of interest it 
becomes apparent what an effective little hunter this animal is. It begins edging up the branch it 
is on towards the prey with the stealth of an assassin. Not only are its movements very slow and 
measured, but it also sways very gently to fool the prey that it is part of the tree moving with the 
breeze. Its body is also flattened from side to side and it attempts to approach the prey so that 
it faces it head on, presenting a small target for a flighty insect to fix its gaze on. Not only is the 
chameleon an expert stalker, it is also a master of disguise. Special skin cells can change size, alter- 
ing the color and tone of the animal. It can’t change from green to some gaudy shade of pink, but 


EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


it can make subtle modifications that help it blend in with the vegetation, or even give it markings 
to blend in with the patterns of the light and shade in the sun-dappled canopy. All of these fan- 
tastic adaptations bamboozle the prey and before long the chameleon is within range of its chosen 
victim. The most elegant part of the chameleon’s hunting technique is that is doesn’t even have to 
be on top of the prey to strike. The final trick in the reptile’s repertoire comes into play when it is 
about a body length from the insect or spider it means to eat. Its eyes stop rolling and both zero 
in on the target, giving it a stereoscopic view. Its mouth opens very slowly to reveal a glistening, 
pinkish blob of a tongue. In less time than it takes to blink, the chameleon leans forward and the 
tongue springs from the mouth, the sticky club at its end adheres to the unlucky victim and before 
it knows what is happening it is hurtling towards the waiting maw of the reptile. The whole act 
is over in a fraction of a second and it is often difficult to tell if the chameleon has been successful 
until you see a faintly quivering insect leg poking out from the lizard’s mouth. 

♦ There are around 80 species of chameleon. They are reptiles of the Old World and are 
found in Africa, Madagascar, Europe, and Asia. They all have the same basic body plan 
with prehensile feet and tail, the swiveling eyes and projecting tongue. The smallest 
species have a body length of around 5 cm, while the largest are more than 60 cm long. 
Some species bear horns on their head giving them the look of a miniature dinosaur. 

♦ When both of the chameleon’s eyes are focused on a target they give it excellent 
perception of depth. This is the key element in their hunting success as it must be able 
to accurately gauge the precise distance to its prey. 

♦ The projectile tongue of the chameleon is a complex system of bone, muscle and 
sinew. At the base of the tongue is a bone and this is shot forward giving the tongue 
the initial momentum it needs to reach the prey quickly. At the tip of the elastic 
tongue there is a muscular, club-like structure, covered in thick mucus that forms a 
suction cup. This attaches the tongue to the prey enabling it to be reeled in. 

♦ The word chameleon is synonymous with deception and’blending in’. Its color 
changing abilities are thanks to the unique properties of its skin. There are two types 
of color cells in the skin: red and yellow. Beneath these cells is a reflecting layer of blue 
and white, underneath this there is a layer of brown pigment. Depending on what 
color the chameleon needs to be, the skin cells get bigger or smaller, modifying the 
color of light that is reflected from the underlying layers. The camouflage skills used 
to hunt prey are the same used to avoid detection by predators, but if they are spotted 
their last line of defense is to straighten their limbs, inflate themselves, hiss and sway 
about in an attempt to look intimidating. 

♦ The chameleons are supremely adapted to an arboreal existence and they are not at 
home on the ground; however, females have to descend to the ground to lay their eggs 
in the soil at the base of a tree.

THE QUEST FOR FOOD 75 



Cone Shells — A cone shell has harpooned and is engulfing a small reef fish. (Mike Shanahan) 


What do they look like? Cone shells are snails with exquisitely patterned shells, normally 
consisting of brown decorations against a light background. The shell can be as much as 
23 cm long. The spire of the shell is not very obvious, giving it the appearance of a short, 
stubby cigar. The only parts of the animal visible outside are the large, muscular foot, the 
long proboscis, which is essentially its mouth and its eye stalks. 

Where do they live? The cone shells are animals of tropical and subtropical waters, typically in 
the western Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific oceans. They are often found on coral reefs, 

A Snail with a Nasty Surprise in Its Shell 

When we think of snails we normally think of the humble garden snail — slow moving, benign 
creatures. However, in the seas, many snails are fierce predators, able to tackle prey larger than 
themselves. The cone shell is one such example. Active cone shells move around their habitat 
using their muscular foot and using their siphon to “taste” the water for potential prey. When 
prey is within range, the snail loads its proboscis with a small harpoon, which is actually a single 
tooth from its radula (the snail equivalent of jaws). The harpoon is long, grooved and has a barb 
at one end and is retained at the entrance of the proboscis by the radula muscle. Once in place 
the proboscis is shot forward and impales the prey on the harpoon, which remains connected 
to the snail by way of a slender cord of tissue, A large muscular bulb and very long poison duct 
inside the snail are used to pump venom into the prey through the hollow harpoon. This venom 
is very potent indeed, containing various neurotoxic and pain-killing chemicals. In no more than 
1-2 seconds the prey is immobilized and as the harpoon is still attached it can be drawn back 
towards the animal where it is engulfed by the capacious proboscis, before slipping into the 
snails stomach. The prey can be sizeable, including small fish and large polychaete worms. In 
those cone shells that feed on other snails, there is no chance of the prey escaping; therefore the 
harpoon is freed from the proboscis. In the species feeding on very active prey, the snail is often 
concealed in the sand, where it waits until the prey is directly above it before thrusting its har- 
poon into the soft underbelly of the fish or worm. 

♦ There are approximately 500 species of cone shell throughout the world’s tropical 
oceans and all exhibit this unique feeding strategy. As the shells of these animals are 
very attractive, they have been coveted by collectors for centuries. One species, the 
glory of the seas, was very highly prized, until large populations of it were discovered. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ In recent years, the venom of the cone shell has attracted much interest from scientists 
who were intrigued by the speed of its effect. It was also discovered that the venom 
contains certain pain-killing components. These pain killers prevent the animal from 
struggling before the paralysis takes hold. The neurotoxic compounds found in cone 
shell venom offer potential new therapies for a range of human conditions, including 
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. A pain killer developed from 
the cone shell has already been tested and is believed to be many times more effective 
than morphine for the relief of pain. It is likely that with the passage of time, more 
medical applications for these compounds will be discovered. 

♦ Due to the interest in cone shells, both from a medical and aesthetic point of view, 
there have been over 30 recorded deaths, following a person carelessly picking up one 
of these shells and receiving a sting, even through gloves and wetsuits. The venom 

of one species, the cigarette snail, is said to be so fast acting the victim will have just 
enough time to have a smoke, before they expire. Unlike snake venom there is no 
known antivenom and the only treatment involves a life support machine until the 
body has had time to breakdown the venom. 

♦ Cone shells are not the only marine snails with an interesting way of catching prey. 
The helmet shells ( Cassis species) use sulfuric acid secretions to cut a hole in sea 
urchins, a process taking no more than 10 minutes. Once the urchin’s defenses 

are breached the snail inserts its proboscis to feed on the flesh inside. The drills 
( Urosalpinx species and Rapana species) are snails that use a combination of 
rasping radula action and acidic secretions to wreak havoc in oyster beds. It takes 
these snails about 8 hours to penetrate a shell 2 mm thick. The proboscis can then 
be inserted through the drill hole allowing the radula to break up the soft tissues of 
the prey. 


COOKIE-CUTTER SHARK 



Cookie-Cutter Shark — The cookie-cutter shark shows its impressive teeth and the damage it can inflict 
on a dolphin (not to scale). (Mike Shanahan) 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 


Scientific name: Isistius brasiliensis 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Chondrichthyes 
Order: Squaliformes 
Family: Dalatiidae 

What does it look like? The cookie-cutter is a small shark. An adult is only around 50 cm 
long and as is the way with sharks the female is larger than the male. The slender, tapering 
body lacks an anal fin and its color ranges from grey to grey-brown. The head is compact 
with eyes near the front. The lips can form an effective suction cup and part to reveal an 
impressive complement of teeth. 

Where does it live? Specimens of this shark have been found in the Atlantic and Pacific, nor- 
mally in tropical waters. The furthest north it has been found is Japan, while to the south 
it reaches at least to Southern Australia. It seems to be more commonly encountered off 
islands, but has also been fished up from open water. It lives at least 100 m below the waves 
and is probably able to plumb depths of at least 3 km. 

A Sneaky, Sharp-Toothed Menace from the Deep 

The cookie-cutter shark, with its flabby little body, is far from the most elegant of the sharks, but as 
with the majority of these marine animals it is a consummate predator and what it lacks in bulk it 
more than makes up for in technique. As it is an animal of the deep sea it has evolved some bizarre 
ways of snatching a meal. In one of the most alien of earthly habitats, many animals can gener- 
ate light, either as a means of illuminating prey, communication, or deception. Special light produc- 
ing cells are found on the bodies of these animals. The cookie-cutter shark can also produce its own 
light; its underside, apart from a collar behind its head, gives off a pale green/blue luminescence. 
From below the shark, apart from its collar, would simply blend in to the diffuse, pale light scatter- 
ing into the depths from above. To a large predatory animal swimming below the shark the collar 
would stand out like a beacon, resembling to all intents and purposes a small fish. This optical 
illusion would be even more effective if the big animal was swimming below a shoal of cookie-cut- 
ters, Fooled into thinking these shapes are some tasty morsels the large predatory animal, be it a 
large fish or marine mammal would head straight for it. Like the marine equivalent of a matador, 
the tiny shark deftly swims out of the way before the predator strikes and using the aggressors 
forward momentum for added purchase the shark latches onto the animal with its suction-cup 
lips before plunging its teeth into its victim’s flesh. The dentition of the shark is by no means run 
of the mill. Its capacious mouth bristles with 25-32 rows of pointed, triangular teeth, the front 
set of which look as though they belong in a miniature man-trap. The lower set are larger than the 
uppers and as they sink into the prey, its forward momentum and a quick pirouette gouge out a 
mouth-sized plug of skin, fat and muscle. This lump of tissue is cradled by the upper teeth and then 
hooked by the smaller upper teeth before being wolfed down. The scar left by one of these attacks 
resembles the neat depression left in a melon after it has been assaulted with a melon scoop, 

♦ The cookie-cutter and its close relative, the large-toothed cookie-cutter, are types of 
dogfish with unique predatory tactics bordering on the parasitic. As they live at such 
great depths little is known about them. The only known specimens have been those 
found in trawl nets. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Although the cookie-cutter is a small shark it is far from the smallest species. The 
spined pygmy shark is reputed to be the smallest, measuring a mere 22 cm. 

♦ Female cookie-cutter sharks produce eggs that hatch inside their body. The offspring 
are nourished by their large yolk sac. Six to 12 young are produced at a time and upon 
emerging from their mother, the young are fully independent and can hunt almost 
straight away. 

♦ The skeleton of the cookie-cutter shark is quite heavily calcified, which probably 
helps it regulate its buoyancy in the ocean depths. Its diet contains little in the way 
of calcium, therefore when its worn teeth are ready to be replaced they are swallowed 
and digested for the calcium they contain. In many other sharks, the teeth are simply 
discarded and fall to the seabed. 

♦ The liver of this shark is large and oily and is an effective buoyancy aid so the animal 
can float in the water column without much effort. 

♦ Many types of sea creature bear the scars of a meeting with a cookie-cutter shark. 
Even submarines are not safe from their gnashing teeth. The rubber-covered sonar 
domes of these vessels are occasionally pocked with the feeding gouges of cookie- 
cutters who would have been undoubtedly disappointed to find themselves with a 
mouth-full of rubber instead of delicious blubber. 

♦ Like most deep-sea animals, the cookie-cutter shark makes daily, vertical migrations 
over distances in excess of 2 km. During the day, they remain in deep water, in what is 
known as the deep scattering layer, but during the night they swim up into shallower 
water, perhaps to within a few meters of the surface. 

♦ The deep scattering layer is inhabited by many animals and is an important foraging 
area for tuna, porpoises, and so forth. It is when these animals visit this twilight zone 
that they fall prey to the fearsome jaws of the cookie-cutter, 

♦ Although the cookie-cutter is specialized to feed on larger marine animals it will also 
eat squids, crustaceans, and other marine invertebrates, 

♦ It has been reported that a cookie-cutter shark gives off its eerie blue-green glow up 
to 3 hours after it has died.

EGG-EATING SNAKE 

Scientific name: Dasypeltis scabra 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Colubridae 

What does it look like? The egg-eating snake is a thin-bodied species that can attain a size of 
around 75 cm. They range in color from gray to brown. Along there back they have dark 
chevrons and or squares/blotches. 

Where does it live? This snake is a native to Southern Africa, It is found in a variety of habitats, 
but does not frequent deserts or forest areas where the canopy is completely closed. It is often 
encountered in areas of thorny scrub with rocky outcrops offering numerous crevices for shelter. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 



Egg-Eating Snake — An egg-eating snake gets its very mobile jaws around an egg. (Mike Shanahan) 


Eyes Bigger than Its Belly... or Perhaps Not 

The word snake conjures up images of animals that subdue active prey with crushing coils or 
deadly venom, but nature never misses an opportunity and there is even a snake that feeds ex- 
clusively on eggs. The common egg-eating snake, with its slight, flexible body can easily negoti- 
ate the thin limbs and smaller branches of trees in the hunt for bird’s eggs. Its flickering tongue 
draws air into its mouth and into contact with the Jacobson’s organ. This small organ functions 
like a nose, picking up the subtle hint of egg odors that may be carried in the air. As soon as it 
picks up the scent it will make straight for the source. The egg-eater is not a large snake, so if 
it chances upon a nest containing some big eggs it will have to continue its search. As soon as 
it finds a clutch of suitably sized eggs the snake will sniff each one carefully. Even from this 
preliminary investigation, the small serpent can assess whether the egg is healthy or rotten and 
how developed it is. Obviously, a rotten egg is out of the question and an egg with a well- 
developed chick inside would be too difficult to eat. What it really wants is a healthy egg with 
a small embryo and plenty of runny yolk and albumin. When it has identified such as an egg, it 
coils its long, thin body around it to hold it in place and proceeds to work its elastic head and 
jaws around the encapsulated meal. The bones forming the skull and the lower jaw of the snake 
are held together very loosely enabling the animal to get its gums around objects that are far 
wider than its head. With meticulous care the snake edges the egg into its mouth. Exerting too 
much force and breaking the egg at this point would be most unfortunate as the nutritious fluids 
would ebb away. As soon as the egg has been edged down into the throat the mouth can be re- 
aligned and closed. With its mouth closed and the egg halfway down its throat, the snake looks 
like it has swallowed a ball and to the human bystander the whole process looks quite painful. 
The muscles of the snake and peristaltic waves in its throat force the egg further along until it 
comes into contact with some specially adapted vertebrae. On their inner surface these bones 
bear a rasping, saw like edge and after being repeatedly brushed against them the egg cracks 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


and its contents slide into the snakes belly. Using its muscular throat the snake squeezes the 
shattered egg to completely empty it of its contents. The remnants are compacted into a small, 
elongate pellet, which is duly regurgitated. 

♦ The common egg-eating snake is one of six species, divided into the African and 
Indian species. There are five African egg-eating snakes and one Indian species, which 
is quite rare. The African species are all found in sub-Saharan Africa. 

♦ Egg-eaters don’t have teeth as they would rupture the egg shell before it passed safely 
into the throat, 

♦ A snakes head and jaws are unique in the animal kingdom. The bones are held 
together so loosely that the whole structure can flex tremendously allowing large 
objects to be swallowed. Unlike all other terrestrial vertebrates the bone of the lower 
jaw is actually composed of two separate pieces linked together by connective tissue. 
These modifications allow snakes to work their head and mandible over the prey. 

♦ The modified feeding apparatus of the snakes allows them to escape the constraints 
on meal size imposed by their thin bodies. Some of the vipers have eyes that are far 
larger than their belly. They can swallow and digest prey items that are larger than 
themselves, the only problem being that such a large meal takes a lot of digesting. 
The prey can rot before it is digested and the snake can die as a result. 

♦ As snakes can take in a large amount of food at once and are very efficient at 
converting it into body mass they can survive for long periods between meals. 

In captivity egg-eating snakes only need to eat about once every month, sometimes 
even less. 

♦ When threatened, egg-eating snakes coil and uncoil, rubbing their scales against one 
another. This produces a hissing or rasping sound and is accompanied by rapid lunges 
with the open mouth. 

♦ Because of its unusual feeding habits the egg-eating snake is a favorite among snake 
fanciers everywhere. They are quite difficult to keep in a vivarium as a constant supply 
of small eggs is required. They have not been reared in captivity, so all specimens 

in zoos and private collections have been taken from the wild, which has impor- 
tant implications for the populations of these snakes in their natural habitats. The 
Indian species is the most endangered egg eater, due to the rapidly expanding human 
population in this part of the world. 

FAT INNKEEPER 

Scientific name: Urechis caupo 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Echiura 
Order: Xenopneusta 
Family: Urechidae 

What does it look like? This spoon worm resembles a great, fat, uncooked sausage. Fully 
grown it can be 50 cm long. Its plump, pink body has no distinctive features to speak of, 
apart from a short, tonguelike projection at its head end a circle of spines on its rear end. 
Where does it live? This animal can be found along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to 

California. It is a specialist burrow dwelling creature that makes its home in the soft mud 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 81 



Fat Innkeeper — The mucus funnel produced by 
the fat innkeeper allows it to trap food from the 
water that it pumps through its burrow. (Mike 
Shanahan)

worm removed from its burrow. (Lynn M. Hansen) 



of tidal flats. Closely related species, similar in appearance and behavior, are found on the 
coasts of Chile, Australia, China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. 

Finding Food the Spoon Worm Way 

The fat innkeeper is an odd beast for a number of reasons. It feeds in a peculiar way, it doesn’t 
breathe conventionally and it has some liberal attitudes to cohabitation. Young innkeepers 
take up residence in the burrow of an adult and will excavate their own lair as they grow. The 
burrow of a fully-grown specimen is U shaped. It descends vertically into the mud for 50 cm 
or so, and continues for 15-100 cm horizontally before striking for the surface. The animal 
spends its time in one corner of this burrow, but can move backward and forward as it pleases. 
The burrow is not only a safe place to hide from the many predators that would dearly love to 
sink their teeth or beaks into a deliciously plump snack, but it is also an integral part of the 
innkeeper’s feeding technique. When the innkeeper is hungry it exudes a cone shaped net of 
mucus from its head end. The opening of this mucus cone is near the burrow entrance so any 
water coming into the animal’s lair will pass through the fine mesh of this net. With its net 
cast, the fat innkeeper begins to pump. A rhythmic undulation along the animal’s body pulls 
water into the burrow and pumps it out the exit at a rate of 18 L per hour. As this pumped 
water is being strained by the mucus net, its fine mesh will trap particles of food. After a lot 
of pumping the net will be clogged with edible tidbits and instead of picking it clean the inn- 
keeper simply detaches the heavily laden net and uses its short proboscis to grab hold of it. 
Slowly and steadily it works the whole net into its mouth and eats it before secreting a new 
one. The innkeeper’s burrow enables it to feed without expending a lot of energy on move- 
ment, however as the water in the burrow may be quite stagnant, especially at low tide, it must 
have an efficient means of extracting oxygen from the water. It must have some form of gill. 
It does and they are up its bottom. Water from the burrow is sucked into its rear end where 
oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse across the thin membrane of the hindgut. Gas exchange 
complete, but in an odd place! 

♦ As with any habitat, refuges on the mudflats are at a premium. The U-shaped burrow 
of the fat innkeeper is one such safe haven and it attracts a small assemblage of animals 




82 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


looking for a place to live. The name 
fat innkeeper was given to this animal 
because of its corpulent appearance and 
the fact is shares its home with a num- 
ber of lodgers. The first of these is a 
small, filter-feeding crab, which feeds in 
the tunnel alongside the second lodger: 
a scale worm, which probably feeds on 
any scraps left by the landlord. Thirdly, 
there is a clam that burrows into the 
mud of the burrow and filters the water 
for nourishment. These three animals 
live exclusively in the burrow, although 
the exact nature of the cohabitation is 
unknown. Perhaps the lodgers are sim- 
ply taking advantage of the sanctuary, 
or maybe they give the landlord some- 
thing in return. There is an additional 
part-time tenant, a goby, which flits in 
and out of the tunnel as it pleases, 

♦ In the places where they occur, fat inn- 
keepers are common animals. They are 
an important component of the mudflat 
ecosystem as their burrows provide a 
home for other animals and irrigate the 
sediment, improving its oxygen content. 
Needless to say an animal like this also has its fair share of predators, such as the 
leopard shark ( Triakis semifasciata), which purses its lips around the burrow entrance 
and gives an almighty suck to dislodge the fat, pink worm. 

♦ The fat innkeeper and other burrow dwelling animals of the mudflats are favorites of 
fishermen who use them as bait. They search the mudflats for the burrows of these 
animals and suck them out with a large syringe type device, 

♦ Mudflats are very productive habitats. The abundance of organic matter in the mud is 
processed by a multitude of bacteria, breaking it down in the absence of oxygen, form- 
ing toxic hydrogen sulfide gas and giving the mud a distinctive stench of rotten eggs. 
When the tide is in the gas percolating into the water is diluted, but when the tide 
recedes any standing water, such as that in burrows will quickly become noxious. Ani- 
mals, such as the innkeeper, have cells that detoxify this gas enabling them to survive in 
their burrows when the tide is out.

^ Go Look! 

Mudflats are very interesting habitats wherever you are 
in the world, but most of what goes on in these places 
happens beneath the surface. They support a huge di- 
versity of animals, from microscopic invertebrates to 
wading birds. Of course, a mudflat comes alive when 
the tide is in and when the tide is out you can walk on 
the mud and see evidence of frantic activity. The mud 
is pocked marked with huge numbers of holes, many 
of which will house some invertebrate far down in the 
mud. There are also tracks left when the owners were 
foraging for food during high tide. Small mounds of 
what look like brown spaghetti are worm casts, left by 
worms after their gut has processed it for edible parti- 
cles. Dig into the mud with a spade and the rotten egg 
smell of the black layer beneath the surface will hit your 
nose. Digging will expose the burrows of many animals 
and you may be lucky to see a large worm retreating 
down a burrow. Place a small spade-full of mud into a 
large white tray with some seawater and you will see 
a range of different organisms: small clams, other mol- 
lusks and many worms. A small amount of this mud 
in a petri dish with seawater examined under a micro- 
scope will reveal a miniature universe of tiny animals 
and single-celled organisms that spend their entire life 
between the mud and sand particles.

GHARIAL 



Gharial — A gharial corrals fish between its body and the river bank. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Gavialis gangeticus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Crocodilia 
Family: Gavialidae 

What does it look like? An adult male gharial can be much as 6.5 m long and weigh several 
hundred kilograms. Females are a great deal smaller than males, but they are still impressive 
looking crocodilians. The snout is very long and thin and is armed with numerous needle- 
sharp teeth. The body is very heavy, yet the limbs are weak. The tail is large and powerful 
and is flattened from side to side. 

Where does it live? The gharial is found in various Asian river systems, including the Indus 
(Pakistan), the Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, Bhutan and India), the Ganges (Bangladesh, India 
and Nepal), the Mahanadi (India), and the Ayeyarwady Kaladan (Myanmar), It prefers the 
deep, fast flowing portions of these rivers. 

Fishing— Crocodilian Style 

The Indian subcontinent and the surrounding areas are dissected by several very large river 
systems. It is the icy peaks of the Himalayas where much of this water originates. Over the eons 
these rivers have carved their way through the rock of the land forming gorges, valleys and flood- 
plains. It is in these narrow gorges, where the water flows deep and fast, that the strangest of all 
crocodilians makes its home. The gharial, sometimes known as the gavial, is the most special- 
ized of all these ancient reptiles. It is for example the most aquatic of the crocodilians, spending 
almost all of its time in the water. They only haul out to bask in the warming rays of the sun or 
to lay eggs. Their bodies are not really built for a life out of the water — the legs are not robust 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


enough or in the right position to carry the weight of the animal on land. To move about out of 
the water the gharial must resort to belly sliding and although it can slip along at quite a pace 
when it needs to, this is hardly an efficient means of locomotion. Thus, the gharial is never found 
far from water. Although awkward and lumbering on the land the gharial is the most agile of the 
crocodilians in the water. Its large tail propels the animal swiftly and easily through the water. 
The gharial’s love of the water is closely bound to its diet, which is more specialized than any 
other crocodilian. As an adult a gharial preys exclusively on fish. Crocodiles and alligators would 
find it difficult subsisting exclusively on fish as they are too quick and can quite easily evade the 
snapping jaws of these reptiles. The gharial is equipped with a host of adaptations that make it 
an almost unparalleled dispatcher of river fish. The snout is long and thin, which means that 
it can be swung through the water with the minimum of resistance. Not only do the jaws slice 
through the water, but they are bristling with many needlelike teeth giving excellent purchase 
on the slippery prey. A typical hunting strategy employed by the gharial is to make a fish corral 
from the riverbank and its body. Fish inadvertently swim into this trap and are rapidly snared in 
the toothy jaws. To swallow the fish impaled on its jaws the gharial lifts its head from the water 
and with a sideways jerk the fish falls off the teeth and deep into the mouth. 

For much of the year, gharials concern themselves with fishing and basking, but from 
November to January the cycle of eating and basking is interspersed with courtship and mating. 
A big bull gharial defends a harem of several females and he mates with all of them, aggres- 
sively driving off hopeful suitors and fighting with other mature bulls who like the look of his 
females. Several months after mating, usually around March to April, the females leave the water 
to lay their eggs. They excavate holes in the sandy riverbanks, depositing somewhere between 
35 and 60 eggs before carefully backfilling the nests. During the incubation period the female 
diligently guards the nest and after around 60 days her offspring hatch. She assists them in leav- 
ing the nest and stays with them until the arrival of the monsoon rains. The heavy and torrential 
rains flood the nest sites and the young are carried downstream to start their own lives, 

♦ The gharials are quite distinct from the other crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators and 
caimans) and they are represented by two species, the second being the false gharial, 
which is found in six river systems in Malaysia and Sumatra. 

♦ Male gharial have a lump on the end of their snout that grows with age. This boss as 
it is known partially restricts the nostrils to the extent where the breath of the animal 
sounds like a buzz or hiss. The males use this sound during courtship and also during 
aggressive exchanges with other males, 

♦ The crocodilians are a very ancient group of animals. The earliest known representa- 
tive of this group is a fossil from the late Triassic, somewhere between 200 and 230 
million years ago. It is now widely accepted they are the closest living relatives of 
birds, which evolved from the other ancient lineage of reptiles, the dinosaurs. 

♦ Just how the crocodilians survived the cataclysmic events that spelled the end of the 
age of the dinosaurs is a mystery. Perhaps they survived because they are normally 
generalists and were able to survive on the carcasses of other animals, seeking refuge 
in the relatively sheltered environment of their aquatic habitat. Following the demise 
of the dinosaurs the crocodilians diversified and for a while they competed with mam- 
mals and birds for the dominance of the terrestrial ecosystems. They were outcom- 
peted eventually and receded to the semiaquatic habitat they are so well adapted to. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 85 


♦ The gharials, with their thin jaws have lost the tremendous bite pressure of their broad- 
snouted relatives, A moderately sized crocodile (3-4 m long) can bite with a force of 
around 960 kg. Compare this to the spotted hyena, which is also featured in this book. 

♦ The gharial is such a specialized animal that its numbers and range have been heavily 
affected by human activities. Dams have been built, waters polluted and riverside 
habitats developed for construction or agriculture. In the 1970s the species came 
within a hair’s breadth of following the dinosaurs to extinction, but state protection 
and tireless conservation have allowed it to regain some of it former glory, especially 
in India. Unfortunately, in other countries the situation is not quite as rosy and the 
gharial remains on the cusp of extinction in these areas.

GIANT ANTEATER 



Giant Anteater — A giant anteater has broken into an ant’s nest and is using its long, sticky tongue to catch 
the inhabitants. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Myrmecophaga tridactyla 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Xenarthra 
Family: Myrmecophagidae 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


What does it look like? The giant anteater is an elongate mammal covered in shaggy gray 
white and black fur. A stripe of black fur runs diagonally from the shoulder to the back. The 
very long, bushy tail can be used to cover the animal’s body. Its small head tapers down into 
a long conical snout. The powerful front legs end in long, curved claws, but to keep these off 
the ground the anteater walks on its knuckles and the sides of its hands giving it a limping, 
shuffling gait. 

Where does it live? The giant anteater is found in Central America and east of the Andes in 
South America, It can be found in both forest and grassland habitats. 

You Need More than One Ant to Make a Meal 

Ants, due to their large nests chock-full of workers, succulent grubs and pupae, are relished by 
a number of predators. Perhaps the most specialized of these is the giant anteater. This ambling 
ant vacuum is the scourge of these insects in Central and South America. 

Even in adulthood the long, conical snout of the giant anteater contains no teeth whatsoever, 
but these are not important for an ant specialist. What is more important is being able to extract 
these insects from their heavily fortified, subterranean nests. To get access to these underground 
galleries and chambers the anteater makes use of its formidable claws, which sprout like miniature 
sickles from its hands. Using its powerful shoulder, back and arm muscles the anteater breaks into 
the nest, but is careful not to cause too much damage. With the nest breached it brings its snout 
into play. As the snout is long and thin it can easily be inserted into the hole left by the claws. The 
ants rush from all corners of the nest to protect their home from this hungry interloper. Their re- 
sistance is, of course, futile. They are caught in the piston like motion of one the most tremendous 
tongues in the animal kingdom. This straplike muscle can be pushed out a remarkable 60 cm. 
A big giant anteater s body may only be 120 cm long; therefore, this massively long tongue, its 
sheath, and the muscles that retract it are all anchored to the animal’s breastbone. In the one min- 
ute in which the anteater feeds at a nest the full length of the tongue may be inserted 150 times 
into the nest. The salivary glands of the animal also produce large quantities of very thick, sticky 
saliva. As the tongue flicks in and out of the nest, workers and their immature brothers and sisters 
stick to it and are drawn back to the anteater ’s mouth. The roof of the mouth bears a number of 
tough bumps, which squash the prey and begin to the grind them up. As they are toothless, fur- 
ther grinding takes place in the muscular stomach. Stones and other debris, ingested as the tongue 
probes the nest, also find their way into the stomach and assist with the blending process. 

The anteater is very careful not to destroy a nest completely. In the minute or so in which 
it probes a nest with its massively long tongue it may only snare 140 ants. The anteater needs 
at least 100 times this amount to survive, but in order to avoid exploiting its prey too heavily it 
visits a number of nests in its territory each day. As forest habitats are speckled with ant nests, 
5-10 adult anteaters may inhabit one square mile. Grassland, on the other hand, is nowhere 
near as productive and a single anteater may require a territory of almost 25 km 2 . To visit all the 
ant nests in such a large area it obviously has to spend a lots of its time walking. 

♦ There are four species of anteater, the giant anteater, northern tamandua, southern 
tamandua and silky anteater. All the species are found in Central and South America. 
The nocturnal tamanduas spend a good deal of their time in the trees and the rat- 
sized silky anteater is a specialist tree-dweller, of which very little is known. The 
favored prey of the tamanduas is termites, whereas the silky anteater likes to feast on 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 87 


arboreal ants. They are related to those other South American mammalian oddities, 
the sloths and armadillos. 

♦ At 32,7°C, the body temperature of the giant anteater, is one of the lowest of all 
terrestrial mammals. This and its slow rate of metabolism means it is far from 
the most active mammal. They spend around 15 hours a day asleep in a shallow 
depression scraped in the ground. Their huge, shaggy tail is used as a blanket and they 
are warned of approaching danger by their sensitive ears and nose. 

♦ The fully grown giant anteater is one of the largest South American mammals and the 
only animals that prey on it are pumas and jaguars. Although the anteater is a slug- 
gish, docile-looking creature it is more than capable of defending itself. More often 
than not it will flee, but it is hardly fleet of foot and may have to resort to combat to 
protect itself. In this case it rears up onto its back legs and slashes at the aggressor 
with its large claws. Its last, ditch defensive tactic is to embrace the threatening animal 
in its very powerful arms. There are documented cases of dogs, large cats and even 
humans being killed in a so-called anteater hug, 

♦ The female giant anteater normally gives birth to a single young. To give birth, the 
female stands upright, using her large tail as a prop. The newborn infant is able to 
cling to the fur on its mother’s back straightaway and she tends her new offspring by 
licking it. The young anteater clings onto its mother for up to a year and at the age of 
around two years it will be ready to start breaking and entering ant’s nests by itself.

HARPY EAGLE 

Scientific name: Harpia harpyja 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 
Order: Falconiformes 
Family: Accipitridae 

What does it look like? The average weight of a fully grown female harpy eagle is just over 
8 kg, although captive specimens have been known to exceed 12 kg. Males are considerably 
smaller, averaging just under 5 kg. The wing span of a fully grown bird is around 2 m. The 
plumage on their back is black in contrast to the white undersides. On the eagle’s head is an 
erectable crest of feathers. 

Where does it live? The harpy eagle is native to the neotropics. Its range extends from 

southern Central America to Northern Argentina, Its habitat is pristine, lowland rain forest, 

A Phantom of the Forest 

High above the shaded floor of a South American rain forest a dark shape glides silently over the 

canopy. Such snatched glimpses of what is, perversely, one of the world’s largest and most power- 
ful birds of prey are not unusual. This formidable animal is one of the world’s least known eagles. 

The only chance for scientists to study this bird is when they chance upon a nest and can observe

the comings and goings from this lofty platform. The nest of a harpy eagle is a large, but rough 
affair in the upper reaches of one of the South American Forest’s tallest trees, the kapok or ceiba 
tree. On a thick mattress of sticks the female eagle usually deposits a single egg. Rarely, she may 
lay a second egg, but in these cases it is neglected when the first egg hatches. Like many eagles, 
the harpy mates for life and the male and female work together to rear the single, essentially 
helpless, down covered young. 

The harpy eagle is an expert carnivore and the forests in which it lives are rich in all sorts of 
arboreal animal life. Sloths make slow progress around the canopy monkeys move through the 
branches in chattering troops, and countless bird species search the trees for fruit. All of these and 
more are on the Harpy’s menu. Its favored prey is the sloth. Catching one of these sluggish crea- 
tures sounds easy but they are very well camouflaged and spend most of their time in amongst 
the thick canopy where not even the aerially accomplished harpy eagle can make hunting sorties. 
To catch such elusive prey the eagle sits on a perch commanding excellent views of the surround- 
ing forest. It may sit and wait for a long time, patiently watching and waiting. Its eyes give it an 
amazingly sharp view of the forest, incomprehensible to us. The pupils are very large, permitting 
enormous amounts of light to hit the sensitive retina without distortion. It is also believed, that 
in the same manner as owls, the eagle can pinpoint the source of sounds thanks to the crest of 
feathers on its head. It raises these feathers every time it hears an unusual sound. 

With its finely tuned senses the eagle sits tight, waiting for an opportunity Sloths will often 
venture out on a limb in order to bask in the tropical sun. It is then the eagle makes its move. It

pitches forward from its perch and extends it wings, which are shorter, but broader than other 
similarly sized eagles. It slices through the air towards the painfully unaware quarry and as it gets 
within striking distance brings its ferocious talons to bear. The claws of this eagle are about 13 
cm long, as long as a grizzly bear’s and are so big they look slightly out of place. The talons grab 
the sloth in a vicelike grip, puncturing its major organs and killing it swiftly. All of this happens 
midflight in an almost fluid action. With its stout wings the harpy eagle is the heavy lifter of the 
bird world and is able to carry three-quarters of its own body weight back to the nest. Once back 
at the nest, the female takes time to remove some fur from the prey before tearing off bite size 
pieces of flesh and feeding them to her waiting young. After six months of this tender care the 
young is ready to leave the nest, but its parents will continue to feed it for another 6-10 months. 
Although these eagles only breed once every 2-3 years, the parental care they invest ensures the 
next generation of these majestic birds will be well prepared for the rigors of life in the neotropi- 
cal rain forests, 

♦ There are around 64 species of eagle. The harpy eagle is one of the largest along with 
the Philippine eagle and Steller’s sea eagle. They are all carnivores with hooked bills 
and powerful talons. The species of open habitat have huge wing spans for soaring, 
while forest species have stouter wings for improved maneuverability, 

♦ The name harpy comes from the creatures of Greek mythology, which had the body 
of an eagle and the face of a human, normally a woman. The mythological harpies 
would grab people and carry them off to the underworld, Hades. Although the harpy 
eagle could not fly off with a person, their fearsome claws and ability to pick prey 
from the canopy inspired their naming after these mythological creatures, 

♦ Although the harpy eagle would never go out of its way to attack a human they can be 
very aggressive especially if their nests are disturbed. 

♦ By a good stroke of fortune, natives in the forests where these birds live consider it 
bad luck to cut down the stately kapok tree, safeguarding the eagle’s nesting sites, 

♦ Although the native Indians are not a threat to these eagles, development in these 
areas is responsible for the destruction of huge swathes of forest each year, fragment- 
ing pristine habitats and making it more difficult for these birds to find prey for 
themselves and their young. Hunting is also reducing their numbers. They are even 
killed by bird collectors who see them as a threat to the macaws, which are coveted by 
the pet trade.

KIWIS 

Scientific name: Apteryx species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 

Order: Struthioniformes 
Family: Apterygidae 

What do they look like? Kiwis have a large, stocky body, a small head and thick legs with pow- 
erful claws. The legs are positioned far back on the body, giving the bird a rather ungainly 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Kiwis — A female kiwi probing the earth for a grub with a cutaway showing just how big her egg grows. 
(Mike Shanahan) 


appearance. The beak is very long and straight and the feathers are so fine they look like 
fur. Long, sensory whiskers grow from the base of the beak. Fully grown, adults range from 
25 cm in height and 1.3 kg in weight (little spotted kiwi) to more than 44 cm and more than 
3 kg (great spotted kiwi). 

Where do they live? Kiwis are found only in New Zealand and some of the islands off its 
coast. They are animals of the forest floor. 

A Bird with Its Feet on the Ground 

New Zealand is unique as apart from three species of bat (one of which is extinct) there are no 
native mammals whatsoever. The birds of this antipodean land evolved to the fill the various 
ecological spaces that are filled in other parts of the world by mammals. The role of a nocturnal, 
insectivorous animal, much like a hedgehog, has been filled in New Zealand by the Kiwi. 

The kiwi, with its brownish, yet glossy pelage is a creature of the night. It emerges from its 
daytime lair to skulk around in the undergrowth looking for food. They are completely bound 
to the forest floor. They have lost the ability to fly and even if they wanted to their wings are no 
more than tiny stubs beneath the hairlike feathers. Not only are their wings small and useless, 
but millions of years of adaptation to a ground dwelling existence has left the kiwis without the 
large keel that runs the length of the breastbone in flying birds. The large muscles required for 
powered flight have to be attached to this bone. Also, as they no longer take to the air, the kiwis 
have lost the delicate, hollow bones of other birds. The bones are large and heavy and are filled 
with marrow. 

Although the kiwis gave up their flying abilities they are very adept, forest floor foragers. 
They are expert hunters of juicy grubs and other soil dwelling invertebrates. They use their beak 
like a very sensitive probe, inserting it into the soil in an attempt to detect the faint odors that 
betray the presence of prey. Unlike all other birds the nostrils of the kiwi are at the very tip 
of its elongate beak and its sense of smell is very sensitive indeed. When it has sniffed out a 
suitable smelling item it will quickly wheedle the tasty morsel from the soil with the skill of 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 


a chopstick expert. On this rich diet of invertebrates and other foodstuffs, like fruit, amphibians 
and crustaceans the kiwis can invest the energy needed to produce its big egg, which is probably 
a quirk of evolution. The modern kiwis more than likely evolved from much larger ancestors, 
which produced big eggs. As the kiwis diversified to fill different niches on the forest floor, they 
shrank but were saddled with the internal arrangement of their forebears — a setup geared to 
producing large eggs. 

The eggs produced by these birds are huge. Although a female kiwi is about the same size 
as a domestic chicken the egg she produces is not much smaller than an ostrich’s. In fact, rela- 
tive to her size, the female kiwi lays the largest egg of any living bird species. When the egg 
is fully developed it takes up a good proportion of the female’s body cavity and can weigh as 
much as 450 g. A chicken egg, in comparison, weighs about 45 g. It is so large, the female can 
only waddle with her massively swollen belly almost touching the floor. As the female has the 
eye-watering responsibility of delivering this huge egg, the male has to do the brooding. The 
egg is laid in a burrow and during the day the father stays with it, brooding it with a bare patch 
of skin on his belly. This brood patch transfers warmth from the male to the egg, but when 
night falls the male takes his leave and conceals the entrance to the burrow before he goes 
off to forage. He keeps up this demanding schedule for as many as 80 days until the young 
hatches, 

♦ There are three species of kiwi, the great spotted, the brown and the little spotted, 
although some experts argue there may be six species. All of these species are found 
in or around New Zealand. There are also three species of very similar birds known 
as tokoeka (Southern tokoeka, Stewart Island tokoeka and the Haast tokoeka). It 
was presumed for a long time the closest relatives of the kiwis were the giant extinct 
birds of New Zealand known as moas, but evidence from DNA shows the closest 
relatives of kiwis are the emus and cassowaries. This suggests the ancestors of the 
kiwi arrived on New Zealand from somewhere in Australia a long time after the 
ancestors of the moas. 

♦ The kiwi is also unusual for its sense of smell, as most birds, with the exception of 
some sea birds, have quite poor olfactory abilities. 

♦ Kiwis are often monogamous animals, mating with the same partner for life, which 
can be as long as 20 years. Only in areas where there are high densities of kiwi does 
this situation of happy families break down as males and females may mate with 
other birds apart from their long-term partner. 

♦ The huge egg of the kiwi places a lot of pressure on the female. For the 30 days it 
takes the egg to grow the female has to eat three times her normal amount of food. 
Two to 3 days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for the 
stomach and she is forced to fast, 

♦ It is not uncommon for a female kiwi to produce more than one egg, but the second, 
or even third, is laid around 25 days after the preceding egg. Females can also lay 
more than one clutch of eggs, with brown kiwis able to lay 2-3 clutches per year, 

♦ Not only is the egg of the kiwi particularly large, but it is also very rich in yolk. An 
average bird egg contains about 35 percent yolk, but a kiwi egg contains around 

65 percent. For the first week of its life the newly hatched chick survives entirely on 
this nutritious substance. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Kiwis, very successful animals in the absence of mammals, were brought to the edge 
of extinction by the introduction of dogs, cats, pigs and stoats to New Zealand. Their 
inability to fly makes them easy pickings for carnivorous mammals used to pursuing 
wary, flying birds. Some of the species are now restricted to heavily protected habitat 
or islands off the coast of New Zealand. 


LUMINOUS GNAT 



Luminous Gnat — In its hammock of mucus and 
silk, a luminous gnat larva has set a number of 
trap threads to ensnare its prey. (Mike Shanahan) 



Luminous Gnat — A larvae of this fly species in its

Scientific name: Arachnocampa luminosa 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Diptera 
Family: Mycetophilidae 

What does it look like? The grub of the luminous gnat is the creature we are interested in here. 
They are maggotlike creatures, pale in color and almost transparent. The cuticle on the head 
is harder than elsewhere on the body giving the animal what looks like a brown helmet. The 
fully grown grub is about 3 cm long. 

Where does it live? The larvae and the adults of this fly species are found only in a few places 
in New Zealand. 


Keep Away from the Lights 

The Waitomo caves in New Zealand are a labyrinth of tunnels, caves and grottos fashioned over 
millions of years by the erosive power of water as it percolated steadily through fissures and 
cracks. Caves are natural refuges. They offer their inhabitants shelter from the extremes of the 
climate and lots of hidey-holes in which to rear young. In some of the larger, vaulted grottos of 
the Waitomo cave system the roof is dotted with a shimmering field of bluish white lights. The 
first time observer could be forgiven for thinking he was looking at a place where the cave roof 
had disappeared giving them a clear view of a fantastically clear starscape. These lights are not 
distant suns out in the cosmos but the glow of myriad fly larvae, each with its own little beacon. 
Although the cave roof with its multitude of lights is a rather unearthly and serene sight it belies 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 93 


the true purpose of these beacons. The lights are actually lures and by shining in the perpetual 
darkness of the cave the fly larvae can attract their prey. The light is just one ingredient in the 
whole prey catching cake. 

The grubs hatch from their eggs and construct themselves a nest, a hammock of silk, using 
specialized glands in their head. They squirm along this hammock and proceed to produce 
more silken threads. These threads can be long as 40 cm and they hang straight down from 
the nest. At intervals along the thread there are little droplets of mucus — like tiny pearls on a 
necklace — each of which was applied by the grub as it produced the strand. These little globules 
are very sticky and it will soon become clear what these are for. 

Below the lights and the sticky, silken strands, the stream that formed the caves meanders its 
way through the blackness. In the water are numerous, immature insects that have inadvertently 
drifted into the cave with the current. Some of them, such as caddis flies and mayflies will be ready 
to the leave the water to begin their brief life as adults in the air. Emerging from the water they are 
fooled by the darkness in the cave into thinking it is night time and the lights above are stars — the 
direction to head for is the sky and away from their larval home. They fly feebly towards the lights, 
but they soon find to their peril that these lights are not what they seem. They soon blunder into 
one of the silken threads with its beads of sticky mucus and rapidly become entangled while flut- 
tering futilely. The gnat larva feels the struggling of the insect through its hammock and heads to 
where the unfortunate victim is entangled. It finds the lucky thread and reels it in at up to 2 mm a 
second using its jaws. The mayfly is powerless to resist as it is drawn inexorably closer to the gnash- 
ing jaws of the carnivorous grub. After it reeled the insect in and consumed it the grub will secrete 
a replacement thread and return to the center of its hammock where it will sit and wait for more 
unlucky insects to be delivered by the gently flowing stream and enticed by its intricate trap. 

♦ The luminous gnat is a type of fungus gnat. These are generally small flies and 
worldwide there are at least 3,000 species, but the adults are so short lived and the 
larvae so hard to find that it is highly likely there are many more species yet to be 
identified. As the name implies they are fond of fungi, especially the larvae and the 
adults are often found around fungi, mating and laying eggs, 

♦ Some of the fungus gnats (i.e., the luminous gnat and its relatives) are the only flies 
that can produce light. Like other light producing animals the luminous fungus gnats 
rely on the chemical luciferin and the enzyme luciferase. The enzyme breaks down the 
luciferin, and light is produced. 

♦ In some other relatives of the species described here, the droplets that cling to the 
silken trapping strands of the nest are actually poisonous, helping to subdue the prey 
as soon as it becomes entangled. 

♦ The luminous gnat is fond of caves to build its trap, as even the slightest breath of 
wind would catch the fine, sticky threads and they would become entangled and 
useless. However, they can be quite common in the forest outside of caves. In this 
situation they make much shorter fishing lines although it is probable they spend 
more time removing tangles and making new lines, 

♦ The adults of the luminous gnat are very short lived animals. They do not feed 
and there only purpose is to find a mate and reproduce. The female can lay around 
120 eggs in total, which are deposited in batches. The males die soon after mating and 
the females die as soon as her eggs have been deposited. 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ When the grub of the luminous gnat is fully grown it pupates and even then its light 
still shines. However, the males glow fades and disappears before he emerges as an 
adult, whereas the female keeps shining bright. It is thought this acts a beacon for 
the males to find the females. The males can wait as she emerges from her pupae and 
tussle for the right to mate with her.

MANTIS SHRIMPS

Family: various 

What do they look like? Mantis shrimps are large invertebrates. The largest species can be as 
much as 36 cm long, but most are between 10 and 20 cm in length. They are often beauti- 
fully colored. They have a flattened body and very large abdomen ending in a shieldlike plate 
known as the telson. Much of the thorax of the animal is protected by a tough carapace and 
in front of this is the head with its very obvious eyes. In all species the second pair of limbs 
on the thorax is large, hugely modified and resembles a folded penknife. The appendages 
beneath the abdomen are adorned with comblike gills. 

Where do they live? Most species of mantis shrimp are found in tropical and subtropical 
regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans. They range from the shores of east Africa to the 
volcanic Hawaiian Islands where they dwell within rock formations, coral or burrows 
excavated in the seabed. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 95 


A Crustacean that Packs a Mighty Punch 

In the clear, aquamarine waters of the tropics every crevice and every hole is the home of some 
sort of animal. In some of these holes, fleeting glimpses of unblinking eyes mounted on short 
stalks can be had. Just what animal owns these restless eyes is difficult to know. Slowly, the 
mystery animal edges cautiously out of its refuge revealing the front of its body, more than 
enough to identify it as a mantis shrimp — pound for pound one of the fiercest predators in the 
sea. They are known as mantis shrimps because of the very well developed limbs slung beneath 
the front part of their body, which resemble the killer weapons of the preying mantis. These 
insects are adept predators, but the mantis shrimp makes them look like well-mannered clergy- 
men. Basically, there are two types of mantis shrimp. There are the spearers and the smashers. 
The second pair of legs in both types has evolved into a seemingly innocuous, neatly folded 
hunting device. In the spearers, the ends of these limbs bear ferocious spines, while the smashers 
limbs are tipped with what are basically clubs. When some suitable looking prey comes within 
striking distance the limbs can be flicked out in around 4 milliseconds. In the spearers this is 
fast enough to impale a fish before it is even aware of the shrimp’s presence. In the smashers, the 
bludgeon is swung at a rate of about 23 m / s (about 80 km/h). This violent force is equivalent to 
a ,22 caliber bullet and is enough to generate a wall of tiny air bubbles. These bubbles collapse as 
they hit the target, releasing heat, light, and sound. The impact can be seen as a flash of light and 
heard as a sharp bang. These forces crash over the victim and are enough to shatter the tough 
shell of a mollusk or crack the resilient carapace of a crab. The victim, killed or at least disabled 
by this tremendous blow is pulled into the shrimp’s lair where it can be eaten at leisure. The 
punch of a smasher mantis shrimp is enough to fracture the glass of an aquarium and there are 
reliable reports of glass, 2,5 cm, thick being broken by these heavyweight crustaceans. 

To allow the mantis shrimps to use their potent claws effectively, they have what are widely 
considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. Each eye is separated into three 
different sections, all of which can used to take a good look at the world. Mounted on their flex- 
ible stalks, the eyes can be swiveled in all manner of directions. Not only can they form clear 
images and perceive depth, but the eyes are also equipped with at least sixteen different types 
of light sensitive cells. Human eyes, in comparison, have only four types. It is difficult to know 
exactly how these impressive animals view the world. They can see at least 10 times more colors 
than us, around 100,000, and survey their habitat in four types of ultraviolet light, infrared and 
polarized light. They must therefore see things invisible to our humble eyes. With such finely 
tuned senses the mantis shrimp can sit like a brooding sentinel at the entrance of its hideaway, 
patiently watching and waiting for an unfortunate victim to swim within striking distance of its 
terrible claws, 

♦ More than 400 species of mantis shrimp have so far been identified. 

♦ The impressive punching power of a mantis shrimp is possible thanks to an 
arrangement of catches that allow the striking limb to be primed and then cocked 
before being released. 

♦ The spearers and the smashers often reside in quite different habitats. The former are 
often found in shallow water, where they excavate burrows in the soft seabed. The 
latter are more likely to be found in areas where the substrate is harder such as rocky 
outcrops or coral reefs. In these rocky places, unoccupied nooks and crannies are hard 
to come by; therefore a smasher will defend its lair vehemently and as result they 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


tend to be more aggressive than the spearers, who instead of fighting over a hole, will 
simply scuttle off and build a new one, 

♦ With their complex eyes, the mantis shrimps have evolved some elaborate behaviors. 
Ritualized fighting for holes and mates is common and individuals use complex sig- 
nals to communicate with one another, sometimes with fluorescent patterns. During 
fights, a mantis shrimp can parry the blows of its opponent by lying on its back and 
using its tough telson as a shield. 

♦ Female mantis shrimps are dedicated parents. They guard and clean their brood of 
eggs until the tiny planktonic larva hatch and disperse into the open water, 

♦ Mantis shrimps are sometimes known as thumb splitters, as unknowing divers and 
fishermen have had the skin on their fingers and thumbs broken to the bone by the 
animal’s punch. 

♦ Although they are common animals and among the most important predators in many 
shallow marine environments, mantis shrimps are poorly understood animals. Most 
species spend most of their life tucked away in their burrows and holes. This secretive 
nature means there is a great deal still to learn about these amazing crustaceans.

Scientific name: Megachasma pelagios 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Chondrichthyes 
Order: Lamniformes 
Family: Megachasmidae 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 


What does it look like? The megamouth is a large shark. Fully grown adults are at least 5.5 m 
in length and 800 kg in weight. They have a very large, broad head, small eyes and five pairs 
of gill slits. The back is grey to grey/black and the underside is white. The upper surface of 
the pectoral and pelvic fins has a distinctive, light margin. 

Where does it live? The distribution and range of this animal is poorly known. The few 
specimens found thus far suggest it is found around the world in tropical and temperate 
waters. Most specimens have been encountered around Japan. The understanding of their 
habitat requirements is sketchy, but they are thought to spend most of their time in mid 
water at a depth of at least 100 m. 

A Shark that Sieves Planktonic Soup 

Until 1976, the megamouth shark was unknown to science. The inadvertent discovery of such a 
large, new species remains one of the biggest zoological stories of the late-twentieth century. It is 
not uncommon for trawlers to turn up several new species of animal, especially during sweeps of 
deep water and poorly mapped areas, but these are small fry compared to the megamouth shark. 
The first specimen got itself entangled in the anchor lines of a United States Navy ship, 40 km 
from Kahuku point in Hawaii, It was a big one, measuring 4.5 m long and weighing in at 750 kg. 
Its gaping mouth alone was almost a meter across. In the 30 years since the accidental discovery of 
this mysterious animal, only 36 other megamouth sharks have been caught or sighted. Ten of these 
encounters have been around the islands of Japan. All megamouth sharks have very flabby bodies 
and the observations of live animals show this species to be a very slow swimmer. The stomachs 
of examined sharks have been densely packed with small, marine shrimps and like the other giant 
sharks, the basking shark and whale shark it is thought to be a filter feeder. In deep water, the 
shark swims along with its mouth open, sometimes closing its rubbery lips to swallow a mouthful 
of food that gets snared on sieve like elements known as gill rakers. To increase the success of this 
rather passive feeding technique the lining of the sharks mouth is silvery and it is possible that in 
the ocean depths this silvery layer could reflect light. Some specimens have also been said to have 
light producing tissue in their mouth. Regardless of the shark actually producing its own light or 
reflecting the dim, scattered light from above, its cavernous maw may glow sufficiently to entice 
small shrimps, copepods and jellyfish to their death. In the dark oceans, light is often used as a 
means of attraction and the megamouth shark may be exploiting this to fill its belly. 

In October of 1990, a large (4.9 m) male megamouth shark was caught near the surface off 
Dana point in California. It was towed, alive, back to the local harbor and after deciding what 
to do with it, was taken back out to sea where a small radio tag was attached to its soft body. 
Upon release the shark headed downward, apparently none the worse for its stressful experience. 
The tag enabled it to be tracked over a two day period. This tag gave a fascinating glimpse of the 
shark’s behavior. During the day the shark would cruise at a depth of around 120-160 m, but as 
the sun set it would ascend and spend the night at depths of between 12 and 25 m. During day 
and night, its progress was very slow and it chugged along at only 1.5-2.1 km/h. Many animals 
that live in midwater have this same pattern of vertical migration. Filter feeding animals like the 
megamouth shark are probably following their invertebrate prey as they move from the ocean 
depths to the surface and back again. Although the tracking showed the megamouth to be quite 
a sluggish species it can swim at these low speeds for long periods of time. 

Apart from this one fleeting glimpse of the daily life of the megamouth shark, very little else 
is known about this intriguing animal and much of that has been gleaned from the capture and 



EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


dissection of dead specimens. What is known is that the megamouth is far from common and if 
the threats to marine life continue it will be enigmatic beasts such as this that disappear first, 

♦ The megamouth shark is the only representative in its family although some people 
think it may actually be closely related to the basking shark. 

♦ The megamouth shark, along with the basking shark and whale shark is the only 
shark species that has forsaken the normal, predatory tendencies of this group for 
a life of sedate filter feeding. Sprouting from the gills, these sharks have finger like 
projections, commonly known as gill rakers. These sieve the water for small, marine 
organisms in a similar way to the baleen plates of the filter feeding whales. In the 
basking shark, these rakers drop off in the winter, which means they cannot feed. Just 
where the sharks go at this time of year is another of zoology’s mysteries, 

♦ Only educated guesses have been made of how the megamouth shark reproduces. The 
ovaries are very similar to other shark species that ovulate large numbers of eggs as 
food for young developing in the uterus. The females also bear scars, indicative of the 
nuzzling and biting behavior of copulating males, 

♦ Several megamouth sharks have shown the scars of meetings with the cookie-cutter 
shark . The megamouth shark may be a favored target of this small, semiparasitic ani- 
mal. It has a flabby body, which is probably easy to excise lumps from. It swims slowly 
and it lives in the same places as the cookie-cutter.

PORTIA SPIDER 



Portia Spider — After stalking its quarry, the Portia spider moves in for the kill. (Mike Shanahan) 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 


Scientific name: Portia fimbriata 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Salticidae 

What does it look like? This is a long-legged jumping spider. The front part of its body 

(cephalothorax) is large and angular. The broad, flat face is studded with a huge pair of glossy, 
unblinking eyes each accompanied by a much smaller eye. Four more eyes dot the head. On 
the legs and abdomen there are ornate tufts of brown, white, and black hair. The males are 
only around 5-7 mm long whereas the heavier bodied females are 6-9 mm in length. 

Where does it live? The species is native to the tropical forests of Australia, Southeast Asia, 
and the Indian subcontinent, where it spends it time on foliage, on tree trunks and the 
vertical surfaces of boulders and rock ledges, 

A Spider that Thinks? 

Amid the tangle of the rain forest undergrowth countless minibeasts play out a continual strug- 
gle for survival. Something with fangs, sharp mandibles, claws, pincers, or a beak lurks around 
every corner. To cope with these varied dangers the hunted have a myriad of defensive adapta- 
tions to protect themselves. To hunt effectively in these forests you must be one step ahead and 
this is exactly what the Portia spiders is. This small spider has taken stalking and hunting and 
turned them into art forms. Its favored prey is other spiders, which is unusual in itself as many 
small predators give them a wide berth. They have poisonous bites and can be difficult to attack 
in their lairs and webs. 

To a predator the size of Portia, the prey it attacks are lethal, but this does not deter this 
amazing little spider. Equipped with camouflaging hairs, making it look like a bit of dirt, the 
Portia spider slowly approaches the web of a prey spider, taking advantage of wind and other 
disturbances to disguise its intent. It arrives at the web and slowly and tentatively it strums the 
silken threads to arouse the occupant’s curiosity. It must be very careful not to mimic the futile 
struggles of an ensnared fly too effectively as the owner of the web will rush out, brandishing 
its fangs. If this was to happen Portia would be in trouble. It must be patient and draw its prey 
out slowly. Only when the owner of the web is within a few millimeters of Portia will it strike, 
delivering a fatal bite. In other situations the Portia spider high on a perch may spot the orb web 
of another potential meal. For anything up to an hour the jumping spider will survey its posi- 
tion, the position of its host and the path it must take to reach it. Its large eyes can form very 
clear images, but only small fields of view can be taken in at one time. With some form of mental 
image of the path it must take the spider sets off. To get to a position where the prey can be 
surprised from the spider may take a very convoluted route, but unlike most other invertebrates 
is doesn’t lose interest as soon as the prey is out of sight. It sees the path and the objective at its 
end. Eventually this smart little spider will get to a position directly above the web and with the 
use of a silken drag-line it drops to within lunging distance of the prey. These complex behav- 
iors can be tuned to the species of quarry in question, suggesting this spider with its miniscule 
brain is somehow capable of learning and problem solving. The seemingly intelligent behavior 
of these spiders baffles scientists. How can an animal with such a small brain be capable of any- 
thing more than simple, reflexive behavior? The key may lie in the way in which the spider sees 



1 00 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the world. As its field of view is very lim- 
ited it must be able to compare a fragment 
of an image with what it has seen before. 
The unique way in which the spider sees 
the world acts a filter, concentrating only 
on the important points. By comparison, 
the eyes of an intelligent mammal are flood 
gates for visual information and it is left 
to the brain to sort the useful information 
from the rubbish. 

♦ There are around 20 species of Portia 
spider, and they are found in Southeast 
Asia, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, 
China, and Australasia. Like any rain 
forest animal there are probably many 
more species to be identified. 

♦ In terms of species the jumping spiders 
are the most successful of all the spi- 
ders, So far, more than 5,000 species 
have been identified. Almost all of them 
have forsaken the ability that distin- 
guishes spiders from other animals: web 
building. Instead of constructing a web 
to snare their prey they actively hunt, 
using their excellent eyes and catlike 
stalking abilities. Like their name 

suggests they are rather adept at jumping and can leap several body lengths to pin 
their prey down in a death grip. Unlike most jumping animals that rely on powerful 
muscles or rubbery proteins to propel themselves the jumping spiders force fluids into 
their legs making them extend violently. Their accuracy is unerring and they rarely 
miss their target.

^ Go Look! 

Jumping spiders can be found in almost any habitat. They 
are instantly recognizable thanks to their huge, front 
eyes. They are warmth loving animals and can be seen 
foraging on the ground, walls and vegetation. Many spe- 
cies are brightly colored or have very bold markings. The 
males often have huge mouthparts that project a long 
way in front of the head. It is very easy to keep a jumping 
spider in captivity to watch its very interesting behavior. 
Any small transparent container with a lid is suitable and 
to make it look like a home from home, stones, bark or 
vegetation can be included in this terrarium. Small in- 
sects, like flies are good prey and a hungry spider will 
stalk a meal as soon as it catches sight of it. Initially they 
approach the resting prey very slowly in the same way 
as a cat creeps up on a bird, always keeping their eyes 
fixed on the target. As soon as they are within range they 
poise themselves by waggling their body very slightly 
before making a killer leap. The powerful front legs 
and the fangs are used to grip the prey until it has been 
completely sucked dry. The courtship behavior of these 
animals is also interesting to watch. The males perform 
a dance by walking in jerky movements and waving their 
pedipalps at the female. The male must be careful when 
approaching the female because if his little dance is not 
up to scratch the female may see him as her next meal. 


PURSE-WEB SPIDER 

Scientific name: Atypus afftnis 
Scientific classification: 
Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Atypidae 




THE QUEST FOR FOOD 101 




Purse-Web Spider — A female purse-web spider 
poises to impale her prey through the side of her 
sock-like web, (Mike Shanahan) 


Purse-Web Spider — An adult female rearing up 
in a defensive posture to show her massive fangs, 
(Roger Key) 


What does it look like? The purse-web spider is one of the primitive mygalomorph spiders, 
characterized by the way in which the fangs move, amongst other features. The carapace of 
the animal is dark, while the abdomen is light brown. The legs are relatively short and thick. 
The fangs (chelicerae) of the spider are huge, approximately one half of the body length. 
Essentially, the spider resembles a small tarantula. As with almost all spiders the female is 
bigger than the male, with a fatter abdomen. 

Where does it live? This spider prefers warm habitats with low vegetation and loose, sandy soil 
that it can burrow in to. It is found throughout Western Europe, as far north as Denmark 
and Sweden. It is often found in coastal locations. It is probably more common than people 
think. 

Living in a Sock 

The females of this long-lived spider, with their formidable fangs are a match for many creepy 
crawlies. The females (and males before they reach maturity) dig into soft soil to make a bur- 
row, which can extend straight down for 15 cm or more. This burrow is lined with fine silk from 
the spider’s spinnerets. The silk lining projects from the mouth of the burrow, forming what 
looks like a small sock, known as the purse web. Small pieces of vegetation and soil stick to this 
purse-web, helping it blend in with the surroundings. This camouflage is so effective that the 
purse web is very difficult to find, but it is often situated in a position where it is not directly 
exposed to the wind and rain, such as the overhang of a large rock or log. It is normal to find 
lots of these little ‘socks’ in the same place, forming a colony. Once the purse web is complete the 



1 02 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


female sits tight and waits for her first meal 
to amble along. Like any ambush preda- 
tor, the wait can be a long one. Any small 
insect or spider is potential prey for the 
purse-web spider and they go about their 
everyday business unaware of the danger 
beneath their tiny feet. Should a hapless 
victim alight on the purse web, the female, 
poised underneath, will strike, stabbing 
the victim through the web with her enor- 
mous fangs. The victim is skewered on the 
female’s huge fangs and she waits for it to 
stop struggling before cutting a slit in the 
web and dragging it into her lair to be con- 
sumed. After feeding, the spider leaves the 
remains of the prey outside the web before 
repairing the slit and digesting her meal. 

The way in which this spider ambushes its prey has important implications when it comes to 
breeding. An amorous male could easily be mistaken for food if he’s clumsy, so in the late sum- 
mer/autumn the male leaves his own burrow and goes in search of females. His is probably led 
to the burrow of a receptive female by her scent and eventually he will arrive at her purse web, 
A blunder by the male now could be disastrous. He tentatively taps on the walls of the purse 
web, and if the female is receptive, he ventures into the confines of the burrow. The two spiders 
will mate and even cohabit for a few months until the male dies. The female does not mourn her 
mates passing but eats him instead. She then makes her egg sac and hangs it up in her burrow. 
It is not until the next summer that the eggs hatch and it is not until the subsequent spring that 
the spiderlings leave the safety of their mother’s burrow and wander off to build a burrow of 
their own. 

♦ The purse-web spider is one of the primitive mygalomorph spiders. These spiders 
have fangs that operate in an up and down fashion, while the fangs of the more 
evolved spiders move in a side-to-side, pincer motion. 

♦ The ambush tactic of the purse-web spider is the lazy approach to finding food, wait- 
ing for the prey to come to it, rather than actively seeking out its victims. Due to this 
low energy approach to life, the spider’s energy requirements are very small indeed 
and it may be able to survive for long periods without eating anything. Most of the 
primitive spiders are ambush predators and this slow pace of life often means they are 
very long lived, compared with many other invertebrates, 

♦ Young purse-web spiders do not disperse far. They are small and will make a tasty 
snack for a myriad of predators if they remain on the surface for too long. Those 
that survive will therefore tend to construct a burrow quite near that of their 
mother’s, 

♦ In the United States, a similar species constructs its sock using a tree trunk or root as 
a support. They feed in the same way as their European relatives. 


^ Go Look! 

This spider is very difficult to find, but should you find a 
purse web, it is possible to trace the silken tube through 
the soil. The female, sensing the disturbance will have 
retreated to the very bottom of her lair. It is not advis- 
able to dig the spider out of her burrow as she will be 
homeless and may perish trying to find and make a new 
home. It is possible to lure the spider into a position 
where it can be seen more easily. To do this, the move- 
ment of a prey animal can be imitated on the web with a 
small twig or a blade of grass. The spider should attack 
and then her path of retreat can be blocked. A female in 
the open will, not surprisingly, feel threatened and will 
rear up in a defensive posture, giving an impressive view 
of her huge fangs.

SHREWS 



Shrews — During the process of refection a shrew laps and nibbles its everted rectum to 
digest valuable nutrients. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: many species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Insectivora 
Family: Soricidae 

What do they look like? Shrews are small mammals. The smallest, the pygmy white-toothed 
shrew is one of the smallest mammals with a head to tail length of 3. 5-4.8 cm and a weight 
of around 2 g. The largest species, the African forest shrew is up to 29 cm long and weighs 
a relatively hefty 35 g. They are mouselike creatures with a long snout, dense fur and small, 
beady eyes. The fur is normally brownish or grey and the ears are often concealed in this 
dense pelage. Their feet have five digits. 



1 04 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where do they live? Shrews are found almost worldwide. Of all the landmasses outside the 
polar regions, only New Guinea and Australasia have no native shrew species. The majority 
of shrews are ground dwelling animals, although there are some species that climb and other 
species that spend a lot of time in water. Predominantly, they are animals of the under- 
growth and leaf litter. 

Furious and Fast Paced 

Although cute and furry the shrews, in reality, are the tigers of the undergrowth. They are secre- 
tive little animals and a fleeting glimpse of something small and furry scurrying through the leaf 
litter is the best view that most people get of one of these insectivores. Shrews are short-lived 
animals and in this brief existence food is unquestionably their number one priority. The shrews 
are so small that the ratio of their surface area to volume is the highest of all the mammals. An 
elephant, by comparison has a small surface area compared to its considerable bulk. The rela- 
tively large surface area of the shrew’s body means there is a lot of space heat can escape from 
and its metabolism must work overtime to keep the body running at a standard mammalian 
temperature. Even when compared to rodents of a similar size, the shrew’s metabolic rate is fast. 
Many shrew species must eat their own body weight in food every day to fuel their internal fires 
and since they carry only enough food to provide energy for an hour or two it is imperative they 
feed throughout the day and night, resting in short bursts. The range of their diet is broad, but 
insects and other invertebrates form the bulk of their diet. Seeds, nuts and other plant matter 
may also be consumed with gusto, as will small vertebrates like reptiles and amphibians when 
they can be subdued. 

As food is very important to the shrew they must have a reliable way of seeking it out quickly 
and efficiently. Their sense of sight is dull, but this is more than made up for by their acute senses 
of smell and hearing. Some species can also use their larynx to generate ultrasonic pulses of 
sound, which is perhaps a primitive form of the echolocation employed by the bats to find their 
way. To help dispatch live quarry found with the battery of senses, some shrews have salivary 
glands that produce venom, giving them a poisonous bite. There are no fangs, but grooves in the 
teeth channel the venom to the bite wound. The venom paralyses the prey, enabling the shrew to 
satiate its hunger immediately or cache the prey for later. 

To further maximize the nourishment gained from their diet, shrews perform an act known 
as refection. To do this the animal must curl up to reach its anus with its mouth, sometimes 
holding the contortion by grabbing its hind limbs with its forefeet. In this uncomfortable pose 
the shrew laps at its anus until after a few seconds, muscular abdominal contractions cause the 
rectum to pop out. The shrew nibbles and licks its rectum for a few minutes before it disappears 
back into the body. The shrew only does this when the intestine has been emptied of feces and 
dissected refecting specimens contain a milky substance in their intestine containing fat globules 
and partially digested food. This could be a way of thoroughly digesting its food and obtaining as 
many trace elements and vitamins as possible, 

♦ There are 368 shrew species grouped into three subfamilies: the white-toothed 
shrews, the African white-toothed shrews, and the red-toothed shrews. In terms 
of species, the shrews are one of the most successful groups of mammals. As they 
are small and secretive it is more than likely that many more species are yet to be 
discovered. 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 105 


♦ Some of the identified species are very poorly known. The Sri Lankan shrew and the 
African forest shrew are only known from a handful of specimens, 

♦ The salivary glands of the American short-tailed shrew produce enough venom to 
kill 200 mice by intravenous injection. The components of shrew venom may have 
applications in medicine and cosmetics. One chemical extracted from their venom 
may be potentially useful in the treatment of blood pressure and other conditions 
of the circulatory system, while another compound with paralyzing qualities may 
be of use in neuromuscular conditions, migraines and even the fight against facial 
wrinkles — shrew-spit Botox, 

♦ Some female shrews and their young are also renowned for what is known as cara- 
vanning. When the litter leaves the nest with their mother they form a line, each 
youngster gripping its siblings rump in its mouth with the one at the front gripping 
the rear end of its mother. Their grip is very strong and the whole caravan can be 
lifted off the ground by picking up the mother, 

♦ The life of the shrew is short and very frantic. The heart pounds inside the tiny chest 
as many as 1,000 times per minute. Individuals of the temperate species are born in 
the summer and somehow must survive the winter. Their unusual metabolism and 
diminutive size makes its impossible for them to enter a state of hibernation like 
other small mammals. In northern climes they forage in the space below the snow or 
in tunnel complexes (their own or those of rodents) looking for over-wintering insects 
and whatever else they can find, including the dead bodies of their own species. If 
they make it through the winter their teeth will be worn out by the following autumn 
and they will perish. 

♦ Glands along the side of many shrews produce a repugnant secretion making them 
distasteful to many potential predators and scavengers in life and in death. In the 
autumn, their tiny intact corpses can often be found.

SPITTING SPIDER 

Scientific name: Scytodes thoracica 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Scytodidae 

What does it look like? This is a small spider with a body length of around 6 mm. It is 
yellowish brown with dark markings. The body is divided into two parts carried on eight 
spindly legs. The front part of the animal is the fused head and thorax, which is large and 
globular compared to the majority of spiders species. On the front of it there are six small 
eyes, thejaws and a pair of small feelers called pedipalps. The abdomen is roundish and 
contains most of the animal’s organs.

Spitting Spider — A spitting spider glues its prey 
to the floor with its sticky, poisonous saliva. (Mike 
Shanahan) 


Spitting Spider — An adult female of this species 
holding her egg sac in her fangs. ( W. Mike Howell) 



Where does it live? The spitting spider has taken to living with humans in their homes and 
any building offering some degree of protection from the elements. Originally, it was prob- 
ably a denizen of natural refuges, such as caves, tree holes, rocky overhangs, and so forth. 

It is found throughout Eurasia and North America. 


No Web, but Still Very Deadly 

Spiders are renowned for the complex webs that they weave, but some species have no need of 
these silken structures as they catch their prey in other ways. The spitting spider is one such 

species. When darkness falls the spitting 
spider emerges from its daytime hideaway 
to look for food, unlike other spiders that 
can move with considerable speed, this 
species seems to be more relaxed and wan- 
ders about with slow, measured strides. Its 
eyesight is very poor, limited to sensing the 
difference between light and dark. Its sense 
of touch, however, is very well developed. 
Tiny hairs on the surface of its body detect 
the faintest change in air pressure that oc- 
curs as a consequence of a nearby resting 
fly shrugging its wings or grooming itself 
The spider homes in on the miniscule 
pressure waves and is eventually upon the 
quarry Any sudden movements now may 
give the game away and the prey may flee, 
so the spider must move slowly and with 
stealth. Initially it gauges the distance to 
the prey by stretching one of its legs to- 
wards to the hapless insect. About 10-20 
mm is the range of choice. If the spider is 


^ Go Look! 

Spitting spiders can be found in many homes and out- 
buildings, especially ones where the occupants are animal 
friendly. During the day and cold periods, the spider 
will hide away in any suitable nook or cranny, such as 
the space behind a cupboard, some old shoes in a utility 
room, or a rarely used chest of drawers. During the 
spring and summer months and even on warm winter 
days it will emerge at night to go hunting. Should you see 
one on a night-time hunting mission, watch the slow, pre- 
cise way in which it moves. If you are very lucky you may 
see it find an insect or small spider and see its relaxed 
response before unleashing its sticky secret weapon with 
alarming speed. You could also catch a spitting spider 
and move it to a transparent box along with a fly or two. 
Be careful moving this spider as its fragile legs can easily 
be damaged. Under a dim light the spider will go about 
its normal business, eventually finding the flies and dis- 
patching them. The see-through container would allow 
you to see the pattern of the spiders squirted trap. If you 
keep the spider for any length of time make sure there is 
something in the box it can hide in. 




THE QUEST FOR FOOD 107 


satisfied it slowly rocks from side to side before dousing the prey with two jets of fluid squirted 
from small holes in its jaws. The fluid not only contains paralyzing venom, but also a very sticky 
adhesive, which glues the meal solidly to the surface it was sitting on. The prey has little time to 
react as the whole spitting sequence is over in a little under l/700ths of a second. Struggling is 
futile. The jaws of the arachnid move from side to side very rapidly as the gunk is squirted, cover- 
ing the prey in a zigzag pattern of sticky poison. With the prey incapacitated, the spider ambles 
over to it and delivers the killer bite, before settling down to feast. 

♦ There are approximately 150 species of spitting spider found all over the world. One 
key to the success of these spiders is their ability to make use of the abundance of 
habitats provided by humans, supplementing the available natural habitats, 

♦ The odd appearance of this spider is due to the presence of large glands in its cara- 
pace, which produce the venom and glue for squirting. When ready to strike, large 
muscles either side of the glands force the carapace to contract, squeezing the paralyz- 
ing adhesive out through the jaw nozzles, 

♦ Almost all spiders build a nest of sorts in which to lay their eggs, but once again, 
the spitting spider has turned its back on elaborate silken constructions and instead 
weaves a simple net of silk to carry its eggs. This net is attached to the female’s fangs 
and goes everywhere with her. 


TRICLADS 



Triclads — A triclad everting its penis from its mouth to stab its prey, (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Turbellarians 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Platyhelminthes 
Class: Turbellaria 
Order: many 
Family: many 

What do they look like? Flatworms are soft bodied, wormlike creatures, which can be oval 
or elongate with all manner of variation in between. All of them are exceedingly thin and 
fragile, for example, marine specimens a few centimeters long are no more than 1 mm thick. 



1 08 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


There are microscopic species and giant forms reaching 60 cm in length, but most are small 
animals, a few millimeters long. Some species have arrow-shaped heads, while others bear 
stubby tentacles. Most species are drably colored in shades of black, brown and gray, but 
some marine forms are spectacularly patterned in bold colors. 

Where do they live? Triclads are aquatic animals, although there are few species that have 
managed to set up home on land, but only in very moist habitats. There are many freshwater 
forms, but the vast majority are denizens of the world’s seas. In terms of habitat there are a 
few free-swimming species, but most are bottom-dwellers, living amongst the sand and mud 
of their watery home. As many species are small they can even go about their daily business 
in between the grains of sand and mud. 


Delicate, but Deadly 

The digestive system of most animals has an entrance, the mouth and pharynx, and an exit, 
the anus, Triclads, because they are either very primitive or very simplified (a bone of con- 
tention among zoologists), lack an anus. The gut of these animals is not a tube, but a blind 
sac. The pharynx is the digestive system’s entrance and exit, with the mouth positioned half- 
way along the body of the animal. This 
unusual setup has given rise to a range 
of interesting adaptations for the capture 
and ingestion of prey. Although paper 
thin and very fragile, the triclads are ac- 
complished aquatic predators. They glide 
along the seabed or lake bottom on a car- 
pet of cilia, seemingly floating, tasting the 
water for the scent of food. Some species, 
when they chance upon a likely looking 
meal, can turn their pharynx inside out 
through their mouth. This technique is 
particularly useful when the prey in ques- 
tion is protected by a tough shell. The 
long feeding tube can simply be extended 
into the prey through a suitable gap. Di- 
gestive secretions flow from the projected 
pharynx and break down the prey's tis- 
sues, The resulting soup can be sucked up 
into the gut of the triclad. In some spe- 
cies, this has gone one stage further and 
the pharynx has evolved into a capacious 
bag that can be used to engulf prey far 
larger than the triclad. 

A capacious pharynx is one thing, but 
the triclad still needs a way of overpower- 
ing its prey as it is soft and thin and has no 
obvious appendages. The penis (cirrus) of

Due to their small size and predilection for aquatic habi- 
tats, these very interesting animals are often overlooked. 
A good way to see these animals for yourself is to take 
a small amount of water from a pond in the spring or 
summer. Use a small jar and look for a place where you 
can easily reach the bottom. Fill the jar with water from 
near the bottom and take it somewhere you can have a 
close look. If you hold the jar up to the light you will see 
a myriad of swimming things in the water, some whiz- 
zing about at high speeds, others creeping along the 
glass. Transfer some of this water into a shallow white 
or light- colored tray. Many animals will show up on this 
background and there, gliding serenely on the bottom 
should be a triclad or one of its relatives. The species in 
small pools and lakes are usually grey and are around 
3 mm or so in length. With the naked eye you will be 
able to see the arrow-shaped head and the tapering body. 
With a magnifying glass you should be able to see the 
dark eyespots. If you have a microscope, transfer one of 
these specimens to a small, transparent dish and take a 
look when it is magnified. The large gut should be clearly 
visible in the semitransparent body and you may be able 
to make out the stirring cilia on its underside, which look 
like short, transparent hairs. The water from the pond 
or lake will contain many other tiny, but fascinating ani- 
mals, all of which look amazing when you take a look at 
them through a microscope.

one species is armed with hardened stylets and this has become an organ that is not only used 
for reproduction. Cruising over the muddy lake -bottom the worm descends on its unwary 
prey and brandishes its penis out through its mouth. The stiletto like weapon is repeatedly 
stabbed into the prey to subdue and kill it before feeding commences. If daggerlike genitals 
are not enough, some other species embrace their prey and use their numerous slime glands to 
produce an entangling slime, which traps it, allowing the triclad to pin in to the surface using 
its suckerlike adhesive organs. The slime produced by some of these animals is neurotoxic and 
quickly paralyses the ensnared prey, allowing the triclad to make short work of it. 

♦ The turbellarians are very successful organisms. They are found in all marine, freshwater 
habitats and terrestrial habitats where there is sufficient moisture to allow their survival 
(i.e., tropical rain forests). There are approximately 3,000 known species, 

♦ They are all very thin because oxygen must diffuse across their body wall straight into 
their tissues. They have no specialized gill-like organs. This system becomes increas- 
ingly inefficient as the animal becomes thicker. In general, the larger the triclad the 
more pronounced the flattening. The large species are less than 1mm thick and cor- 
respondingly fragile. 

♦ The largest species of triclad (Rimacephalus arecepta) lives in Lake Baikal in Russia 
where it feeds on dead and dying fish in the depths of this great body of water. It can 
be as much as 60 cm long. 

♦ On the outside, triclads are very simple, but they show surprising internal complexity 
with a diverse array of tissues, organs and organ systems. They have a distinct brain 
and many species have large eye spots on their head. 

♦ Almost all triclads have male and female sexual organs making them hemaphrodites. 
Individuals come together and will exchange eggs and sperm. In some species this can 
be quite a rough process as the stiletto-like penis is pushed through the body wall of 
the partner to inject the sperm. 

♦ Depending on the time of year some species lay summer or autumn eggs. Summer eggs 
have thin shells and hatch quickly, while autumn eggs have thick shells and are resistant 
to the ravages of winter, only hatching when fairer conditions return in the spring. 

VELVET WORMS 

Scientific name: Onychophorans 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Onychophora 

Class: Onychophora 

Order: Onychophorida 

Family: Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae 

What do they look like? The velvet worms look like slugs with legs. They have a long body 
with 14 to 43 pairs of stubby legs (depending on the species and sex) and at the head end 
there is a pair of antennae. The skin of the animal looks rather velvety, hence the common 
name. They range in size from 1.4 to 20 cm. Most of the species are relatively small. 

Where do they live? All of these animals are found in the Southern Hemisphere, They are 
known from the tropical regions, such as the East Indies, the Himalayas, the Congo, the

West Indies, northern South America and temperate regions, including Australia, New 
Zealand, South Africa, and the Andes. Although their distribution encompasses a range of 
climatic zones they are always found in association with cool, moist microhabitats, 

Soft-Bodied Night Stalkers 

The velvet worms were first described in 1826 and at the time they were thought to be related to 
the slugs, snails, and other mollusks. Today, much more is known about these animals, but they 
still arouse interest because of their fascinating biology. All velvet worms are predators and they 
catch their prey in a very interesting way. Most species emerge from their daytime hideaways to 
hunt for prey in the humid cool of the night. They amble along on their short, fat legs using the 
sensory organs in their antennae to detect the faint signs of their prey, which includes just about 
anything smaller than themselves. When they pick up the scent of their prey they will follow 
the trail until they are almost on top of their quarry. Their eyesight is not the best, but their 
sense of smell and touch are very well developed. Ready to strike, the velvet worm can employ 
its secret weapon. Either side of the velvet worms mouth there is a small fleshy turret. These 
lumps are connected to large glands inside the animal that produce a sticky slime. With the prey 
in its sights, the velvet worm rears up and squirts two streams of slime at the unfortunate prey. 
This slime can be squirted up to 30cm and almost immediately it begins to harden, entangling 
the prey in a net of sticky threads. With the prey incapacitated, the velvet worm ambles over to 
it and begins to feed by passing poisonous saliva into the body of the animal, which starts the 
digestion process. The velvet worm then sucks the partially digested tissues into its mouth. 

Apart from their amazing feeding behavior, some species of velvet worm have also evolved a 
unique way of fertilizing their eggs. The males of these species crawl over the females body and 
deposit a small packet of sperm (spermatophore) randomly on her side or back. Over time a 
female may accumulate several such packets from a variety of males. Somehow, the spermato- 
phores trigger blood cells within the female to dissolve the underlying skin, allowing the sperm to 
escape from their parcel into the body cavity of the female. Free in the female’s blood the sperm 
must swim for the female’s sperm storage organs, where fertilization will take place. This is not 
the only complexity in the reproductive behavior of this animal. Some species lay eggs. Other 
species produce eggs that hatch inside the female’s body. A few species of velvet worm have dis- 
pensed with shelled eggs altogether and give birth to live young. These young are nourished 



THE QUEST FOR FOOD 111 


inside the female’s body by a secretion produced by the uterus, which reaches the young either 
through a special membrane or a direct placental-like connection to the uterine wall. 

♦ There are 110 described species of velvet worm. Their appearance suggests they are 
living fossils that have remained essentially unchanged for hundreds of millions of 
years. Fossils, at least 500 million years old, have been found showing the impres- 
sions of marine animals that look strikingly similar to the living velvet worms. The 
earliest fossil showing what appears to be a terrestrial velvet worm is approximately 
300 million years old. The locations where these animals are found also indicate great 
antiquity. The continents in the southern hemisphere were once joined in one gigantic 
landmass, known as Gondwanaland, but the continents, sitting on their huge conti- 
nental plates drifted away from one another, carrying their living cargo with them to 
give us the arrangement of the continents we see today and unusual distributions of 
the surviving ancient animals. 

♦ There are two families of velvet worm and they have different distributions. The 
peripatids are predominantly equatorial and tropical while peripatopsids are all found 
in what used to be Gondwanaland. 

♦ Because of their great antiquity, the velvet worms are regarded with great interest by 
those scientists who investigate how different animals are related. The velvet worms 
possess characteristics that make some people think they are closely related to the 
annelid worms, but other characteristics suggest a closer affinity with the arthropods 
(insects, spiders, crustaceans etc). Some even think they represent a so-called missing 
link between the annelids and arthropods. Recent findings point to the velvet worms 
being more closely related to the arthropods than they are to the annelids. Only time 
and further investigations will reveal the true relationships of the velvet worms. 

♦ Recently, it has been found that some velvet worms are capable of complex social be- 
havior. Groups of around 15 individuals dominated by an adult female, live, hunt and 
feed together. An animal’s place within the group is determined by bouts of fighting. 

♦ The skin of the velvet worms contains the substance known as chitin, which is found 
in the skin of arthropods. As this material does not stretch, an animal with a chitin 
containing covering must periodically shed its skin. In velvet worms this can occur as 
often as every 10 days, 

♦ Velvet worms, unlike many invertebrates have quite a long life span, at least six years 
in some species, 

♦ The velvet worms are restricted to humid environments or only emerge during the 
night when it is cool and humid. One of the reasons for this restriction is that the 
breathing apparatus of the velvet worm, the trachea, are open to the air, without any 
form of valve that conserves moisture. Arthropods, like insects have closeable spira- 
cles limiting their water loss.

Scientific name: Mellisuga helenae 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 
Order: Trochiliformes 
Family: Trochilidae 

What does it look like? A fully grown male bee hummingbird is around 5.5 cm long and 
about 1.9 g in weight. Females are larger, with a body length of just over 6 cm and a weight 
of 2.6 g. They are attractive birds with iridescent plumage. The male is bluish with a whitish 
grey underside, although during the breeding season his head, chin and throat take on a 
pink/ red hue. The females are more greenish with a white belly. 




114 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? The range of the bee hummingbird is restricted to the island of Cuba in 
the Caribbean and the nearby Isla de la Juventud. They are forest animals, preferring the 
edge habitats around the perimeter of these large tracts of vegetation. 

Small, but Perfectly Formed 

The bee hummingbird is a zoological wonder. Its beautifully feathered body little bigger than a 
large bee, still has all the features, albeit in miniature, that are unmistakably those of a bird. It is 
one of the smallest warm-blooded animals, yet it has a tiny heart, a brain, little feet and perfectly 
formed wings. Small size in warm-blooded animals is associated with a furious pace of life and 
the bee hummingbird is no exception. It does everything at breakneck speed. To fuel such a tiny 
body the fires of metabolism burn fiercely. The favored food of this bird is the energy rich nectar 
produced by plants. This sugary solution is just the sort of stuff the bee hummingbird needs to 
fuel its metabolism. Flowers evolved as a means of attracting insects for the purposes of pollina- 
tion; therefore they are hardly built to take the weight of a perching bird. The bee hummingbird 
gets around this problem with some very impressive aerobatics. Its small wings lack the hinged 
joints of other birds, which means they can be beaten by the powerful wing muscles in a figure- 
eight pattern. During normal flight the wings beat about 80 times a second, although during 
its courtship displays they flap 200 times a second. This gives the tiny bird precise control over 
speed and direction. The flying jewel can fly forward, backward, sideways, and upside down. 
It can stop dead in the air and hover with mechanical precision. Such delicate skills enable it 
to probe its favorite nectar flowers with its beak. The thin tongue darts into the flower to lap 
at the sweet liquid. In one day the bee hummingbird may visit more than 1,500 flowers and in 
doing so may take on board more than eight times its own weight in liquid. Such a volume for 
a small animal amounts to a huge number of calories, which in human terms would be more 
than 150,000 (the normal amount for a human is about 2,500). The bee hummingbird’s internal 
workings operate at a pace akin to the blurring beating of its wings. For example, its heart, which 
also happens to be the largest, relatively, of any warm-blooded animal, beats at around 1,200 
times a minute (our heart rate is about 70 beats per minute). Digestion is similarly rapid. On the 
odd occasion it consumes an insect, the digestive system can process it in a little over 10 minutes. 
In larger animals this process can take many hours. Such speedy metabolism gives the bee hum- 
mingbird a very high body temperature of around 40°C, the highest of any bird. 

Only when the food is at its most abundant can the bee hummingbird interrupt its foraging 
to look for a mate. During the courtship display the male hovers in front of the female beating his 
wings at terrific speed before shooting straight into the air to a height of around 15 m, his metallic 
plumage catching the rays of the sun. The daring little suitor then free falls back to earth stopping 
his descent right in front of the female using the deftness of his hovering. After mating the female 
builds a tiny nest constructed from moss, spiders webs and down. This is attached to a small branch 
and because of the materials used in its construction it blends in perfectly with its surroundings. 
Into the tiny cuplike nest are usually deposited a pair of tiny, white eggs, little bigger than peas. The 
female incubates them and in around two to four weeks the young hatch. The young are helpless 
and are completely dependent on their mother who must up her food forays to feed her offspring. 

♦ The hummingbirds take their name from the sound they make when they fly. 

The wings beat so fast they make a humming sound. They are restricted to the 

Americas, They are at their most diverse and numerous in the tropics and the 



GETTING FROM A TO B 115 


subtropics where the high temperatures and long or never ending growing season 
enables them to thrive. They are a specialized group and have diversified into more 
than 300 species. 

♦ As the metabolism of a hummingbird is so rapid and in need of almost constant 
fuelling, night time presents something of a problem. They must rest, but as they are 
not eating they would quickly perish. They overcome this conundrum by going into 
what is known as torpor. This is where the metabolism slows right down to the point 
where it is just ticking over so as to conserve energy and stop the tiny warm-blooded 
creature from dying during the night. 

♦ The beautiful, iridescent plumage of the hummingbird has long made them a favorite 
amongst collectors. Aboriginal people used hummingbird feathers to decorate head 
dresses and so forth and in Victorian high society, the tiny stuffed bodies of these animals 
would adorn expensive hats. Fortunately, such accessories are no longer fashionable 
helping to ensure these magnificent birds are protected for future generations to enjoy.

COMMON SWIFT 



Common Swift — A common swift in flight, showing its very efficient wings. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Apus apus 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 
Order: Apodiformes 
Family: Apodidae 

What does it look like? This small, brown bird is usually around 16 to 17 cm long with a 

forked tail and a large pair of wings that form a crescent shaped span of around 40 cm when 
the animal is in flight. They can weigh up to 56 g. On the chin there is a small patch of white 
feathers. The beak is short, but wide. The feet are small and positioned far back on the body. 

Where does it live? The common swift is an animal of the air. It is a migratory species, so it 
spends the temperate winter in Sub Saharan Africa and flies north in the spring, ranging as 
far north as Scandinavia and as far east as the Himalayas and Pacific coast of Russia. 



116 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Masters of the Air 

No other birds can compete with the swifts for sheer mastery of the air. In many ways they are 
an aerial reflection of certain fish and sharks that ceaselessly cruise the world’s oceans. These 
aquatic animals have a hydrodynamic form that can cut through the water with utmost ease. 
Although the common swift glides through the air, it too has certain adaptations that allow it 
to cut through the air with an amazing elegance. The body is compact and streamlined and the 
feathers pad out and smooth all the angles of the body. The wings are long and taper to a fine tip. 
This shape is ideal for reducing drag as the bird flies through the air. The bones in the wing of 
the swift near the body are short and stocky and allow the surface of the wing to be moved with 
considerable force by the flight muscles, enabling high speeds to be reached. During displays and 
disputes when they go into steep dives, common swifts can reach speeds of 60 m per second, 
which can only be matched by certain falcons and other, larger swifts. The bones in the wing that 
extend from the elbow towards the tip are long and mobile giving the swift amazing agility in the 
air. Typically, the common swift flies at around 5 to 14 m per second for hunting purposes. Like 
a filter-feeding fish, with its mouth wide open, the common swift flies through the air collecting 
tiny insects as it goes. If it is collecting these insects for nestlings it will hold them in a saliva 
bound ball in its throat. Nestlings are very hungry and each bird in a breeding pair may have to 
deliver 40 helpings of insects to the young every day. Building the nest, brooding the eggs and 
feeding the young are the only times that a common swift stops flying. It is phenomenal because 
it does everything else on the wing. It feeds by catching aerial insects, it drinks by skimming 
water from the surface of a lake or puddle and it sleeps in the air and even mates in the air. More 
amazing still is the fact that a fledgling common swift does not breed until its third or fourth 
year, which means that when it does come to set up a nest it will be the first time it has folded its 
wings for two or three years. The distances these birds cover in a single year are astonishing and 
are probably 200,000 km at the very least. Most confusing among the swift’s aerial abilities is its 
sleep flying. How does it fly and sleep at the same time? Again, it is difficult to know for sure as 
it is difficult to record a swift when it is sleeping. Sleep, in most animals, is a natural relaxed state 
when they have reduced awareness of their surroundings. Sleeping and flying don’t mix — just 
ask a pilot. Somehow the swift has found a solution to this problem and it is thought that it can 
rest one half of its brain at a time. While one half of the brain rests, the other half takes over all 
the functions and vice versa. During these bouts of sleep the bird may only be capable of simple 
flying and may be forced to ascend where it can fly in steady circles for a while. The common 
swift probably divides its sleeping into small naps instead of one long, continuous slumber. 

♦ There are around 96 species of swifts, swiflets, and needletails, all of which have the 
same general body plan. They are all expert flyers. 

♦ Swifts resemble those other masters of the air, the swallows and the martins, but in 
actual fact they are not closely related, they just happen to look the same because they 
do the same thing. This is another example of convergent evolution. 

♦ The nest of the common swift is composed of material that it finds on the wing, such 
as feathers, dry grass, straw, dead leaves, winged seeds, flower petals, and paper scraps. 
Nest building can take sometime especially if conditions are calm and there has been 
insufficient wind to lift suitable material into the air. 

♦ The appearance and the flying abilities of the swifts are a consequence of hunting 
aerial insects. Many types of insect and spider spend at least some of their life in the 
air together with bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists. This so-called soup of small 



GETTING FROM A TO B 117 


creatures and microorganisms is known as aeroplankton and many different animals 
depend on it, 

♦ Bad weather makes it very difficult for common swifts to hunt, which would be 
disastrous for the ever-gluttonous nestlings. Fortunately, the chicks have an adapta- 
tion that allows them to drop their body temperature and to enter a form of torpor. In 
this state of slowed metabolism the chicks lose their wild hunger, for a while, at least. 

♦ Naturally, the swift is an animal of rock faces and cliffs, but human habitations have 
given them a whole new range of nesting sites to exploit. 

♦ Certain species of cave swiftlet from Southeast Asia build their nest entirely from 
saliva. These nests are the key ingredient of bird’s nest soup, which is a delicacy in 
oriental cuisine. Nests collected from caves using towering bamboo scaffolds com- 
mand a higher price than those obtained from purpose-built nest houses. The nest in 
the soup has a gelatinous texture and is it said to be good for general health, however, 
in some people the soup can cause the excessive secretion of stomach acid. 

♦ Swifts are utterly reliant on insects for food and are therefore at risk from the indis- 
criminate use of insecticides in modern, intensive agriculture. 


EMPEROR PENGUIN 



Emperor Penguin — An emperor penguin feeds the young it has 
nurtured in its remote breeding grounds. (Mike Shanahan) 



118 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Aptenodytes forsteri 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 

Order: Sphenisciformes 
Family: Spheniscidae 

What does it look like? This is the tallest and the heaviest of the penguins. Adults can be up 
to 115 cm tall and weigh anywhere between 22 and 37 kg. Its stature is complemented by its 
glorious deep black and shimmering white plumage accented by a golden patch of feathers 
on either side of its neck. The wings are reduced to flippers. The legs are very short and 
positioned at the very back of the animal so it can stand and walk upright. 

Where does it live? The emperor penguin is restricted to the cold waters of the Antarctic, 
They are rarely found north of 65 degrees south and only leave the water for significant 
lengths of time to breed when they take up residence on the pack ice of the continental 
shelf or islands in waters of the far south. 

An Antarctic Trek without a Sled 

The Emperor penguin is a master of survival. Annually it spends large tracts of time in one of 
the most inhospitable places on earth and at the most unpleasant time of year. The place is Ant- 
arctica and the time is winter. The story begins in March or April when the males leave their true 
home, the sea, to begin a long, slow walk inland. Their progress is impeded by the fact they don’t 
really have the legs for it. With a combination of awkward waddling or sledging, where they lie 
on their belly and kick themselves along, they eventually reach their rookeries. They may have 
shuffled and slid up to 120 km. The males are soon joined by the females who started their mi- 
gration a little later. When the females reach the rookeries the males begin posturing and calling 
to attract a mate and if successful they form a monogamous relationship for the breeding season. 
Soon after they have forged their bond they mate and in May or early June (at the height of the 
southern winter) a single large egg tipping the scales at around 450 g is laid by the female. For the 
time being the female’s work is done and she carefully passes the egg to the male who balances it 
on his feet and drapes it with a large roll of skin. The female makes the arduous journey back to 
the sea to stock up on food and for the next 64 days the male broods the single, large egg. During 
this time he does not eat, but sustains himself throughout the bitterly cold winter on deposits of 
fat laid down when he was feeding out at sea. For much of the incubatory period the male sleeps 
as a way of conserving energy and all the males in the rookery, abandoned by their mates, huddle 
together for warmth forming a tight, milling throng where every male has a go in the relatively 
warm middle. They really need to huddle. The weather is numbingly cold and the wind can reach 
speeds of 200 km/h. After approximately two months, the female returns from the sea and re- 
lieves the male of his egg-sitting duties. Unerringly, the female can locate her mate in the throng 
by his call, in a cacophony of hundreds or thousands of calling males. With the utmost care he 
passes the egg to the female and heads to sea. Not a morsel has passed his lips in over 110 days. 
Several more weeks elapse and the male returns, his belly full, to his mate and baby. The female 
has been feeding the chick, now hatched from its egg, on regurgitated food and the male can now 
do the same. The chicks have to grow rapidly and before long they have moved off their parent’s 
feet and form creches on the ice with other downy youngsters. The parents make regular trips to 
the sea to collect food for their chick, locating their offspring on their returns by its calls. By the 



GETTING FROM A TO B 119 


time they are 150 days old the chicks will have almost lost their downy covering and many will 
have been abandoned, left alone to find their way to the sea where they will take to the waves, 
only returning to land five years hence, to breed themselves, 

♦ The penguins are a group of 17 species of bird, which are superbly adapted to an 
aquatic way of life. On land they are very ungainly creatures but they glide through 
the water with graceful ease, slicing through this dense medium, propelling them- 
selves with their stubby, paddle-like wings. Their plumage also retains a layer of air, 
acting as buoyancy aid. Fossils show that the modifications to the standard bird 
form and way of life, very evident in the penguins, are very old — at least 40 million 
years and possibly as much as 65 million years, 

♦ All penguins are found in the southern hemisphere. Not many species of penguin are 
actually found as far south as the emperor and the Galapagos penguin lives on the 
equator year-round — but in the relatively cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Hum- 
boldt Current. The penguins of cold environments have dense plumage and thick 
blubber to help them survive the harsh conditions of these very southerly conditions. 

♦ The bird cousins of the penguins, the auks, exploit similar niches in the northern 
hemisphere. The largest species of auk, the great auk, was around 75 cm tall. The last 
pair was killed in 1844 in Iceland. Auks resemble penguins physically and in color 
patterns. Their resemblance is an excellent example of convergent evolution. 

♦ Not only is the emperor penguin a hardy bird, it is also an animal capable of 
prodigious diving feats, reaching depths far out of the reach of other birds. The diet of 
these penguins consists of crustaceans, fish and cephalopods and during their hunting 
missions they can dive to depths of 560 m and hold their breath for 20 minutes, 

♦ Penguins of cold environments have a complex circulatory system in their 
appendages to avoid the ravages of frostbite and hypothermia. Blood returning 
from a foot in contact with the cold ice is warmed up by the descending blood in 
a heat-exchange-type system. This ensures the animal’s core temperature is not 
lowered by the frosty conditions. 

♦ There are thought to be approximately 200,000 breeding pairs of emperor penguin 
alive today. These may seem like a lot of animals, but they are severely at risk from the 
effects of climate change.

EUROPEAN EEL 

Scientific name: Anguilla anguilla 
Scientific classification:

Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Anguilliformes 
Family: Anguillidae 

What does it look like? An adult European eel is a long, snakelike fish; however, during its 
development it goes through several stages that bear little or no resemblance to the adult. 



1 20 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



European Eel — A female European eel migrates back to the ocean crossing land where she has to, (Mike

Adult females can be 1.5 m in length and 2 kg in weight. Males, on the other hand, are 

much smaller. 

Where does it live? This eel spends most of its time in bodies of freshwater throughout 

Europe, however when fully grown it takes to the sea in order to spawn. 

Where There Is an Eel There Is a Way 

The life history of the eel is one of the most remarkable and bizarre in the whole animal kingdom. 
For centuries, it baffled scientists and today there are still unanswered questions. The eel has always 
been coveted by Europeans and it has always been known that during the fall, large numbers of 
adult eels would descend the streams and estuaries and head out to sea never to return. Then, each 
spring vast numbers of young eels, known as elvers, would mysteriously appear in their millions in 
estuaries, heading upstream. It was assumed that the eels must reproduce somewhere out at sea, but 
the location of this spawning ground was completely unknown. It took many decades and funds 
from the Carlsberg foundation to provide some of the answers. Small animals, frequently encoun- 
tered in nets out at sea were thought to be small fish completely unrelated to the eels. These tiny, 
leaf-like creatures are in fact the larvae of eels and a Danish scientist spent much of his career trying 
to find the smallest of these larvae, which would indicate their birthplace. His search led him across 
the Atlantic to a warm, calm patch of ocean called the Sargasso Sea, It seems the adult eels swim the 
6,000 km from their home streams to the Sargasso Sea over a period of 1-2 months and apparently 
at great depth. At the start of this migration the body of the eel undergoes massive changes. Its gut 
dissolves, so the prodigious swim must be fuelled with the deposits it laid down when it was feed- 
ing in freshwater. Its eyes become bigger and pigments within them change so the fish can see in 
the dim light of the ocean and the sides of it body take on a silvery luster as a camouflage to help it 
evade the many predators that will be waiting for it in the open ocean. The mammoth migration to 
the breeding grounds exhausts the eels, so much so that once they have spawned, the adults die. The 
eggs, nurtured in the calm, warm waters of the Sargasso Sea hatch into miniscule larvae that must 
begin the arduous task of swimming back to the rivers, lakes and streams where their parents came 
from, following the taste of their home waterways. Such a small creature is relished by predators and 



GETTING FROM A TO B 121 


huge numbers of them are gobbled up. After two years of perilous and slow progress, the larvae will 
be in the middle of the Atlantic, and a further year will take them to the coastal waters of Europe. 
Here, they change from leaflike animals into creatures more reminiscent of eels. These elvers begin 
to swim upstream, but the males go no further than the estuaries or coastal rivers, whereas the 
females continue inland, sometimes for hundreds of miles, overcoming barriers with fishy tenacity. 
The females feed and grow for 8-15 years before heading downstream to join the males where they 
will be unerringly drawn to complete their life cycle in the distant Sargasso Sea, 

♦ There are approximately 400 species of true eel. They range in size from 10 cm to 3 m 
monsters weighing more than 100 kg. 

♦ The European eel is a nocturnal predator, feeding on small animals such as fish, 
arthropods, crustaceans and mollusks. 

♦ The European eel is very similar to the American eel, but the American species 
migrates from freshwater bodies all along the eastern coast of North America to the 
same spawning ground as the European eel: the Sargasso Sea. The distance that this 
species travels to and from its breeding grounds is much less than that traveled by its 
European relative, 

♦ A substance in the blood of eels is poisonous to some fish and mammals, but cooking 
destroys the toxin. 

♦ When eels are migrating they can traverse considerable barriers to reach their desti- 
nation. Adult females returning to the sea will commonly leave the water and slither 
across patches of dry land. Their skin produces copious quantities of mucus that aids 
their passage. When elvers are migrating upstream they will overcome small barriers 
by piling their bodies up against the obstacle until they start pouring over its top. 

♦ The Sargasso Sea, an area of ocean in the Atlantic, roughly 3,200 km long and 
1,100 km wide is a mysterious place. It exists because it falls in the confluence of 
several ocean currents that form a large area of calm, slowly rotating water. The area 
moves, tracking the surrounding currents and at its surface there are huge expanses 
of seaweed known as Sargassum. The water is warm and very salty and it supports 
an assemblage of animals that live amongst the floating weed. Large fish are rare as 
there isn’t the food to support them making the Sargasso Sea a refuge for young eels. 
With a changing climate it is uncertain what will become of the ocean currents in the 
Atlantic, especially the Gulf Stream. Should any of these currents lose strength or 
stop, the Sargasso Sea may cease to exist, 

♦ There have been eel fisheries for thousands of years as the animal is a popular food 
item. They are caught as adults or as elvers, A common name for elvers when they 
are around 45 mm long is glasseels. In recent years, the numbers of these juvenile eels 
caught in places like Epney on the River Severn in the United Kingdom have declined 
dramatically, so much so that in 1997, the demand for them in Asia could not be met 
and huge sums were changing hands for available stocks. Some dealers were paying 
more than $1,100 per kg of glasseels. The reasons for this decline are not understood. 
It could be part of a natural long term trend, or human activities could be severely 
reducing their numbers and preventing them from reaching their spawning grounds.

FLYING DRAGONS 


vj 



Flying Dragons — A flying dragon extends its 
ribs for a controlled glide. (Mike Shanahan) 



Flying Dragons — One of the smaller flying dragon 
species in the hands of a biologist who is teasing 
the ribs apart to show the skin gliding surface. (Jim 
McGuire) 


Scientific name: Draco species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Agamidae 

What do they look like? Flying dragons are small, thin bodied lizards with long, tapering tails 
and slender legs ending in five sharp-clawed digits. Most species are approximately 20 cm 
long, but some can reach nearly 40 cm. Much of this length is tail. In most species females 
are larger than males. They are colorful creatures and both sexes of a few species have a bright 
fold of skin beneath their head called a gular flap, which can be extended to function like a 
small flag. The flap is always present in males, but absent in females of many species. 

Where do they live? Flying dragons are native to the forests of southern India and Indomalay- 
sia where they scurry up and down trees, rarely venturing to the ground. 


Glide to Get Where You Are Going 

In the lush Malaysian forest a flash of color darts from the trunk of a tree and alights on another 
tree several meters away. The bright colors disappear and whatever made it is now camouflaged 
against the bark making it difficult to see. The animal scampers up the tree and its movements 
reveal it to be a lizard, but no ordinary lizard. It is one of the only reptiles that can take to the 
air. It cannot fly like a bird, bat or insect, but its gliding abilities are second to none. What makes 
this reptile unique are the structures it uses to glide. Flying animals and most gliding ones have 



GETTING FROM A TO B 123 


modified forelimbs that function as wings or flaps of skin (patagium) stretched between the 
limbs forming a kind of parachute. Flying lizards have elongate ribs protruding from their body 
covered with skin, forming fan like wings. The ribs are mobile and for much of time the wings 
are held tight against the body and the lizard looks relatively normal. However, moving around 
its habitat, hunting and chasing mates the animal may take to the air with a daredevil leap. It 
spreads its rib wings and glides to another tree. The glides of the flying dragon are very elegant 
aeronautical maneuvers. Initially, the animal goes into steep dive at an angle of around 45° be- 
fore leveling out and using the momentum from the dive to carry it some distance horizontally. 
When the landing site is in range the lizard goes into an upward glide and alights delicately on 
the new tree using its sharp claws for purchase. Without pausing to reflect on its feats, the lizard 
folds its ribs against its body and frantically scrabbles up the tree seeking more prey or a mate. 
For such a small animal the distances achieved in these glides are remarkable. Glides as long as 
60 m have been recorded, over which the animal loses only 10 m in height. When you consider 
that a flying lizard is only around 20 cm long, this is quite some distance, 

♦ There are 35 known species of flying dragon. They are among the few modern lizards 
able to take to the air. There are fossils of extinct reptiles with gliding surfaces formed 
from ribs, as in the flying dragons. 

♦ Flying dragons are diurnal and are active from around 8 a.m. until it gets too 
hot, around midday, at which point they will seek out shade. Their day resumes 
at around 1 p.m. 

♦ These lizards are insectivores and specialize in catching ants that scurry around on 
their trees. They are 'sit and wait’ predators, clinging very still to their tree, until a 
hapless insect wanders past, 

♦ Courtship amongst these lizards is complex and colorful and is thought to take place 
between December and January, although in some areas the lizards may breed all 
year round. In many species the gular flap and the wings of the lizards, especially 
the males, have bright splashes of color. When an amorous male likes the look of a 
female he extends his flap and bobs his head drawing attention to the brightly colored 
bib. He will also open and close his wings in an effort to impress the female with 

his dazzling colors. In some species the courtship display is topped off with three, 
body-bobbing circuits around the female, who at this point is hopefully impressed 
enough to allow the male to copulate, 

♦ Male flying lizards are fiercely territorial, defending perhaps two or three trees, on 
which there might be two or three females. Trespassers are treated with disdain and 
the owner will chase and harangue the interloper until it leaves, 

♦ The only time a flying lizard ventures to the alien terrain of the ground is when a 
female is ready to lay her eggs. She descends the tree she is on and makes a nest hole 
by forcing her head into the soil at the base of the tree. She then does an about turn 
and lays a small number of eggs (2-5) before filling the hole and patting the soil 
down with her head. For the first 24 hours she is a model parent, guarding the eggs 
vehemently, but then, seemingly bored, she leaves and has nothing more to do with 
her offspring. The eggs hatch after approximately one month. 

♦ Throughout the course of animal evolution, several unrelated groups of animal have 
taken to the air. Animals that master the air have access to a whole new way of life. 



1 24 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Flying animals can exploit new sources of food, travel great distances and successfully 
evade their ground dwelling predators. The air has been conquered by (in chronologi- 
cal order): insects, pterosaurs (extinct), birds and bats. In all of these animals, gliding 
was probably an intermediate stage. Today, there are several different animals capable of 
gliding. The gliding frog has modified feet for gliding, while the flying geckos have flaps 
of skin along their body. The flying snake flattens its body to glide and the numerous 
gliding mammals have a membrane of skin that is stretched between their fore and hind 
limbs. Flying fish can glide for considerable distances on modified pectoral fins. There 
are even gliding squid. Gliding is very common in the forests of Southeast Asia, espe- 
cially Borneo; yet there are fewer gliding species in South American or African forests. 
The reason for this could be the fact that the trees in the Southeast Asian forests are 
often taller and more widely spaced than the trees in other forest. In these Old World 
forests there are also fewer vines and other connective tendrils between the trees.

FOUR-WING FLYING FISH 



Four-Wing Flying Fish — A four-wing flying fish spreads its fins to take to the air. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Hirundichthys ajfinis 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Beloniformes 
Family: Exocoetidae 



GETTING FROM A TO B 125 


What does it look like? A fully grown four-wing flying fish is around 30 cm in length. The 
pectoral fins and the pelvic fins are greatly enlarged with bold banding patterns. The tail fin 
is nonsymmetrical with a long lower lobe. The body is conical and slim. 

Where does it live? This is a fish of the Atlantic Ocean and is found in both the East and West 
as far south as northern Brazil. It is also found in the north of the Gulf of Mexico and the 
Caribbean as well as the Arabian Sea, 

A Whole New Meaning to Water-Wings 

In the waters of the western Atlantic, a small shoal of dolphin fish, large, fast marine predators, 
pursue a shoal of smallish, pretty unremarkable looking fish. With powerful flicks of their tail 
fins the dolphin fish surge through the water in a final lunge at their unfortunate prey. Sensing 
imminent danger, the prey fish takes evasive action, developing an impressive turn of speed at the 
surface of the water, covering about 30 body lengths per second. With their dorsal fin and head 
breaking the surface they give a few more powerful sweeps of their tail and they break free of their 
aquatic environment. Now, this is itself is not all that unusual. Lots of fish species breach the sur- 
face, some in amazing leaps, but what is amazing about this particular fish is what it does next. In 
the air, the fish extends its pectoral and pelvic fins, revealing them to be huge and graceful looking 
wings. The flying fish can’t flap these wings, but the momentum it built up beneath the water is 
enough to allow it to glide effortlessly for at least 50 m and occasionally much further. The pectoral 
fins provide the surface for gliding while the smaller pectoral fins act as stabilizers giving the fish 
a certain degree of control over its movements whilst airborne. Released from the impeding drag 
of the water the speed of these gliding fish increases greatly, up to around 60 km/h and perhaps 
even more. To remain airborne for as long as possible the flying fish dips the elongated lobe of its 
tail fin into the water and frantically thrashes it. This gives it another burst of forward momentum 
and the glide continues. To extend its glides still further the flying fish can also use waves to its 
advantage by gliding on the updrafts at their leading edge. Using the waves in such a way flying fish 
can glide for distances of at least 400 m. Apart from the elegantly adapted fins, flying fish also have 
eyes that allow them to see as well out of the water as they do in it. Light is not refracted in the air; 
therefore, to accurately judge distance out of the water the flying fish has eyes that are less rounded 
than those of other fish. Eventually, the muscles powering their tail fin will tire, and they will slip 
cleanly back into the water, hopefully a long way from the confused dolphin fish. 

♦ The ability to leave the water and predators behind is a highly effective means of survival. 
There are at least 70 species of flying fish found throughout the world’s oceans. They 
are fish of tropical and subtropical waters as the cold waters in the far north and south 
would not be conducive to the rapid muscle activity that takes them clear of the water. 

♦ Some species of flying fish are only around 15 cm long, while others may be as much 
as 45 cm in length. The band-wing flying fish is one species with four wings. Some 
species have only enlarged pectoral fins and relatively normal pelvic fins. Regardless 
of this they are all adept at gliding. 

♦ It is not uncommon to find flying fish on the decks of boats after an overeager leap 
from the water. 

♦ Although the flying behavior of these fish is probably a way of avoiding predators it 
may also be used as means of getting from one place to another as some scientists have 
suggested it may be more efficient than swimming through the dense medium of water. 



1 26 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Flying fish are actually predators themselves, feeding on small crustaceans, and so 
forth, when small and progressing onto larger prey, including other fish as adults. 

♦ In the Caribbean, especially Barbados, the flying fish are a very popular food animal. 
They are used in a dish called Cou-Cou. These fish are also popular in Japan where 
they are normally dried and eaten. Their eggs are also used in some types of sushi. 

♦ Some species of flying fish make regular migrations, following food or to and from 
their breeding grounds. In some areas, especially the Caribbean, human activities have 
polluted and damaged these routes, harming the populations of these fantastic fish. 
The damage to their habitats is compounded by commercial fishing as large numbers 
of these fish are taken every year for human consumption. 

♦ Some species use the floating mats of Sargassum seaweed as nurseries for their young. 
During their early life, flying fish are incapable of the gliding feats of adults and so 
they lurk amongst the weed relying on camouflage for protection.

GRANT’S GOLDEN MOLE 



Grant’s Golden Mole — Under the 
cover of sand, a Grant’s golden mole 
ambushes an insect larva. (Mike 
Shanahan) 



Grant’s Golden Mole — An adult of this species 
above ground. The dense fur completely covering 
the eyes and the powerful forelimbs can be clearly 
seen. (Galen Rathbun) 


Scientific name: Eremitalpa granti 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Afrosoricida 
Family: Chrysochloridae 

What does it look like? Grant’s golden mole is a small mammal. Adults are 7 to 8.5 cm in 
length and between 16 and 32 g in weight. They lack any outward signs of eyes or ears, 
giving them a rather surreal appearance. The fur is grayish yellow with a golden sheen. 



GETTING FROM A TO B 127 


Where does it live? This mammal is limited to a small part of Southwestern Africa, Its range en- 
compasses some of South Africa and the Namib Desert in Namibia. The habitat of this very 
specialized animal is the pinkish/ red coastal sand dunes. They are restricted to these habitats 
and cannot spread out inland as the sand is firmer and unsuitable for their style of tunneling. 

Swimming through the Sand 

In some of the desert areas of Southern Africa, shallow grooves appear in the sand as if an 
invisible finger is tracing a line. No invisible, giant hand is at work here and the tracks are actually 
caused by a small, industrious mammal — Grants golden mole, the smallest of the golden moles, 
but perhaps one of the best understood. Unlike other subterranean mammals Grant’s golden 
mole does not burrow. The sand is too fine and too loose for this so this little animal actually 
swims through the sand. Like all other golden moles, Grant’s golden mole has become supremely 
adapted to a subterranean existence, losing many of the mammal characteristics that are surplus 
to requirements underground. Soon after birth, the eyelids fuse and thicken, to eventually be cov- 
ered by thick, shimmering fur, which has a beautiful iridescence. To prevent soil and other debris 
from entering the nostrils these animals have a little leathery flap of skin on the end of their snout, 
which also helps them nose their way through the sand. The digging prowess of golden moles is 
made possible by their heavily muscled shoulders, which power the forelimbs through the sandy 
soils of their habitat. The third digit on each paw is very well developed and along with the first 
and second digits bears hefty, curved claws. It is with these tools the golden mole paddles through 
the sand, shoveling the material towards the rear where it is kicked backwards by the webbed 
hind feet. Although it is an excellent burrower, tunneling is an expensive way of getting around, 
in terms of energy and it will often move around on the surface. During its hunting forays, which 
take place during the cool of the evening this little mammal can cover a distance of almost 6 km 
whilst looking for food. That is equivalent to you or I covering a distance of 150 km in one night 
to look for dinner. The favored prey is termites, but they also take other desert invertebrates like 
beetles, moths and spiders. Unwary reptiles are also on the menu. During these forays Grant’s 
golden mole spends a lot of time on the surface occasionally slipping beneath the sand to pinpoint 
the victim with its ears before ‘swimming’ stealthily up to the delicious morsel like some manner of 
miniature submarine. Unlike most other mammals, the ear openings are tiny and sound energy is 
actually picked up as vibrations through the sand and beneath the surface the golden mole prob- 
ably picks up the astonishingly faint pitter-patter of termite feet. This feat is made possible by the 
massively enlarged hammer ear bone that picks up these vibrations and amplifies them. 

The deserts where Grant’s golden mole dwells are notoriously inhospitable. Daytime tem- 
peratures are uncomfortably high, so to seek shelter when the sun is beating down on the sand 
the mole will dig down to depths of around 50 cm and go into a state of torpor, switching off 
its temperature regulation systems thus conserving valuable energy. Water is also very scarce in 
these habitats, but the golden mole’s very efficient kidneys mean that it never needs to drink, 
instead it obtains all the fluid it needs from its food, 

♦ There are 21 species of golden mole, and all but one of them are restricted to South- 
ern Africa. They all have the same basic body plan and most species are conventional 
burrowers, forming lasting tunnels in soils and even in sphagnum moss. 

♦ Fossils of golden moles around 25 million years old have been found, but they are so 
like the living species; they tell us little about the origins of these enigmatic mammals. 



1 28 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Although golden moles may look like true moles and marsupial moles they are all 
unrelated. The similarity in appearance is simply due to the fact they have all evolved 
to live a subterranean existence, 

♦ There is still a great deal to learn about the life of Grant’s golden mole. As it cannot 
form any permanent burrow or nests in the loose sand it is unknown how or where 
they breed. No nests have ever been found, but as they suckle their young they must 
have a permanent base for a while, 

♦ Some of the golden moles have very small geographical ranges, making them intensely 
vulnerable to habitat loss. Of the 21 living species at least 11 are endangered.

LEATHERBACK TURTLE 



Leatherback Turtle — Leatherback turtle young hatch from their eggs to begin their life out at sea. (Mike 
Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Dermochelys coriacea 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Chelonia 
Family: Dermochelyidae 

What does it look like? The leatherback is the largest turtle, with a shell length of 2 m, a flipper 
span of 3.5 m and a weight of more than 700 kg. It lacks the distinctive, bony shell of the other 
turtles, instead this structure has been replaced by a lightweight, streamlined carapace that has 



GETTING FROM A TO B 129 


a series of seven ridges running along its length. The front flippers are huge and generate the 
forward momentum for swimming. Its dark upper surface is flecked with patches of white. 
Where does it live? The leatherback turtle lives in the open ocean. It can be found throughout 
the world’s oceans, but cannot tolerate the cold conditions in the high polar regions. 

Carefree Ocean Cruising 

The leatherback turtle is the largest and most peculiar of all the turtles. They begin life deep 
down in the sand of a favored nesting beach, where females haul their considerable bulk from 
the water to excavate nest holes for their eggs. For a marine animal, supremely adapted to life in 
the water, this is no mean feat and the female scrapes and pants and snorts until she has dug out 
a deep hole that will protect her eggs. This hole will be made in sand that is suitably moist, but 
safely beyond the reach of waves. She can lay as many as 1,000 eggs in a season, separated into 
batches of 50-170. The digging of a nest hole is as far as the female’s maternal instincts extend 
and as soon as she has covered over the clutch with sand she makes for the sea in a zigzag fashion 
to cover her trail. The young hatch after several months and their first task is to dig themselves 
from the nest hole. For a turtle that is just getting used to its flippers this is not easy, but soon 
enough they clamber out of the hole and on to the beach. This signals the start of a long and dan- 
gerous gauntlet the young must run. Apart from some tough scales and strength of numbers, the 
turtles are defenseless and many beady eyes have been surveying the sand waiting for their emer- 
gence. Gulls, skuas, and crabs all descend on the turtles and make short work of them. So many 
young emerge at once that a few are bound to break through this barricade to the safety of the 
surf. The young’s swimming abilities are instinctive and as soon as they enter the water their tiny, 
flailing flippers propel them out to sea. In the open ocean, danger is also ever present and many 
more turtles will be taken by predators, A fortunate few are able to avoid the gnashing jaws of 
other sea creatures and scour the oceans looking for food. The favored foods of these turtles are 
gelatinous, floating creatures such as jellyfish. They are hardly the most appetizing sea food, but 
they are easy to catch. There are no teeth in the turtle’s jaws, but its throat is lined with backward 
curving spines that help it swallow its jellylike food. As the turtle grows, the unique structure of 
its carapace becomes ever more obvious. The thick leathery skin covers a complex arrangement 
of small, linked bones embedded in cartilage. Compared to a normal shell, this structure is very 
lightweight and enables the leatherback turtle to range for thousands of miles around the globe. 
Only females ever make the return journey to land to deposit their eggs, males on the other hand 
will live out their whole life at sea, cruising the oceans with powerful strokes of their flippers. No 
one is sure over what distances the leatherback turtle ranges, but an individual tagged in Suri- 
nam, in South America, turned up on the other side of the Atlantic, over 6,800 km away. Unlike 
the other marine turtles, the leatherback turtle is not limited to tropical and subtropical waters, 
A large animal loses heat more slowly than a smaller creature so the great bulk of this reptile 
gives it an advantage in cold water and a thick layer of fat minimizes the amount of heat that is 
lost through the skin. An efficient circulatory system uses the heat generated from swimming to 
warm the blood returning from the cool limbs. All these adaptations allow the turtle to hunt in 
the cold productive waters from Iceland all the way down to New Zealand. 

♦ There are around 300 species of living turtle. They are divided into the marine forms 
with legs modified into flippers, terrestrial forms with thick, pillar-like legs and 
semiaquatic forms (the terrapins and snapping turtles). The turtle skeleton is perhaps 



1 30 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the most peculiar of all the vertebrates. Not only do they have a shell, composed of 
fused, bony plates, but the pelvic and pectoral girdles supporting the forelimbs and 
hind limbs are found inside the rib cage. 

♦ The breeding beaches used by the leatherback turtle were a mystery until relatively 
recently. Today, several beaches scattered throughout the tropics are known to be used 
by the turtle. Most are mainland sites facing deep water. They seem to avoid those 
beaches protected by coral reefs. Many leatherback turtles will deposit their eggs on 
the same beach they hatched from. 

♦ It is difficult to say exactly how long a leatherback turtle can live for, but such a large, 
slow growing creature must live for at least 100 years and possibly far longer. 

♦ Today, many of the turtle species are severely threatened by habitat loss and hunting. 
A turtle’s shell can protect it from most predators, except humans. Many species are 
hunted for their meat, which is a delicacy in many parts of the world. The marine 
species must all come to land to breed and the sheltered, sandy beaches on which 
they depend are at the mercy of tourist and industrial developments. Negligent use 
of the seas has also endangered many species as they are caught and suffocated in 
fishing nets, injured by boat propellers and harmed by pollution. Even on protected 
beaches, hatchlings are often confused by city lights and end up scuttling away from 
the sea.

NORTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA 



Northern Bluefin Tuna — A section through the body of a northern blue fin tuna showing the arrangement 
of its enormous muscles. (Mike Shanahan) 



GETTING FROM A TO B 131 


Scientific name: Thunnus tbynnus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Perciformes 
Family: Scombridae 

What does it look like? The bluefin tuna is flattened from side to side but is very deep-bodied. 
The powerful body tapers strongly to the thin tail and sickle shaped tail fin. The pectoral fins 
are long and rigid and are positioned not far behind the conical head, with its large mouth and 
eyes. The back of the fish is deep bluish purple and the underside is a shimmering silver. The 
largest bluefin on record weighed more than 750 kg and was around 3 m in length. 

Where does it live? This fish is found in the Atlantic Ocean and ranges throughout this 
expansive body of water, including temperate and tropical waters from the far north to the 
Mediterranean, Black sea and coasts of Brazil and West Africa. 

Hydrodynamic Perfection 

The bluefin tuna is, arguably, the pinnacle of fish evolution in terms of swimming ability. Its body 
is so well adapted to its way of life that it can cruise for thousands of miles with ease and in the 
pursuit of prey or escaping from danger it can accelerate to speeds more than a match for all but 
the fastest boats. Such speed and power is made possible by the huge muscular bulk of this fish. 
The whole animal is little more than a dense block of muscle. From the skeleton outwards there 
is layer after layer of muscle fibers all of which pull in concert to drive the sickle shaped tail fin 
through the water in short, powerful sweeps. Much of muscle in the tuna has a limited ability 
to use the oxygen present in the animal’s blood; it is anaerobic, therefore most of the energy is 
generated in the absence of oxygen. These fast-twitch muscles contract and relax very rapidly 
generating a lot of power, but only for short bursts at a time as. Such activity in the absence of 
oxygen leads to the build up of lactic acid, eventually causing muscular fatigue, A much smaller 
proportion of the fish’s muscle mass is dependent on the oxygen carried in the blood and it is 
this aerobic tissue, tapering down the sides of the body to the tail, which contracts to provide the 
slow, steady action required for long distance cruising. 

Both of these muscle groups channel their straining effort through a pair of tendons an- 
chored to the sickle-shaped tail fin. With each flick of the tail, in contrast to most other fish, the 
whole of the body remains more or less rigid, increasing the efficiency of each stroke. In bouts 
of fast and furious swimming, the tuna’s progress through the water is further enhanced by the 
other fins nestling in shallow depressions on its body, reducing drag. 

Not only can the tuna shoot through the water like an aquatic bullet, but an interesting ar- 
rangement of blood vessels allows it to swim in water cold enough to deter other fishes. The 
exertion of the animal’s muscles generates a great deal of heat and this warmth is captured by 
a heat exchange system where it is passed to cold blood traveling to the central nervous system 
and eyes, keeping them responsive even in chilly, temperate waters. This is a massive advantage 
for the bluefin tuna as it allows the animal to hunt effectively in waters, normally the reserve of 
warm-blooded creatures, such as marine mammals. 

♦ Apart from the northern bluefin tuna the world’s oceans are also home to the south- 
ern bluefin and Pacific bluefin. There are nine other species of tuna, all of which have 



1 32 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the same general appearance as the bluefin, but are considerably smaller. All the tuna 
and their relatives, the mackerels and bonitos are carnivores adept at using their great 
bursts of speed to capture prey. 

♦ The heat exchange system of the bluefin tuna enables it to hunt as far north as the 
cold waters off Newfoundland. 

♦ The bluefin tuna vies with a few other species for the crown of the fastest fish. There 
is the sailfish and the marlin, both of which are reputed to reach speeds of 100+ kmh 
in short bursts, 

♦ The tuna’s gills are ventilated by the rapid flow of water around them as the animal 
swims. If the tuna stops swimming it will die from a lack of oxygen. 

♦ Bluefin tuna swim huge distances. Tagged individuals have been tracked from the 
East Atlantic to the West Atlantic and back again in one year and it is very likely they 
cover even greater distances. During their ceaseless oceanic wanderings they tend to 
stay quite near the surface but they dive to depths of almost 1,000 m to hunt. 

♦ Tuna have small deposits of magnetite in their head and it is thought these act like 
a built-in compass, picking up the earth’s magnetic field allowing the fish to orientate 
itself in the vastness of the open ocean, 

♦ The bluefin tuna, unlike the other tuna species is slow growing. Individuals may live 
for at least 30 years. 

♦ The large size of the tuna and the quality of the flesh has made it a favorite of fishermen 
everywhere. The bluefin tuna, with its huge size, is the most coveted of these fish and 
sadly, today, it is the rarest species. Before 1970 the bluefin tuna was not held in high 
regard. Captured specimens were normally rendered down for use in pet food. Then, 
the species rapidly gained a following in Japan as something of a delicacy, A large fishery 
grew and today stocks are severely depleted to the extent where fine examples now com- 
mand huge prices, A 200 kg specimen sold in 2001 fetched more than $173,000 dollars. 

♦ Catching a bluefin tuna is no mean feat. They range over thousands of square kilome- 
ters of open ocean and in many cases long-line fishing is the weapon of choice. Long- 
lining involves paying out up to 130 km of line bristling with thousands of hooks.

SEA LAMPREY 

Scientific name: Petromyzon marinus 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Cephalaspidomorphi 
Order: Petromyzontiformes 
Family: Petromyzontidae

Sea Lamprey — The sea lamprey’s fierce 
looking mouth. (Mike Shanahan) 



Sea Lamprey — An adult sea lamprey. Note the 
gill holes and complete lack of jaws. (Horst Tara- 
schewski) 


What does it look like? The sea lamprey has a snakelike body with no paired limbs of any kind 
and no jaws. In the place of bitingjaws there is an oral disk. The eyes are large and well devel- 
oped and behind them are seven pairs of gill openings. Toward the end of the animal there are 
fins running along its back and underside. Color varies, but the back is normally green or gray, 
while the belly is white or pale gray A fully grown sea lamprey may be as much as 1 m long. 
Where does it live? The habitat of the sea lamprey is the northern Atlantic Ocean and the 
western Mediterranean, together with streams on the eastern coast of North America, 
Western Europe, and the Mediterranean basin. 

A Chinless Wonder 

The sea lamprey is a relic, a real blast from the past. It has many features of the first, primitive 
backboned animals, and it somehow manages to survive in a world dominated by higher, more 
evolved forms. Like many outwardly primitive animals, the sea lamprey has a very interesting 
life history and some unique adaptations allowing it to thrive in a number of different areas. The 
tiny eggs of a female lamprey are a little over 1 mm in diameter. These shell-less, unspecialized 
eggs hatch into 6-10 mm, pink, wormlike larvae, which are so unlike their parents that early bi- 
ologists described them as distinct animals, christening them ammocoetes. For a week or so after 
they hatch the ammocoetes stay in the nest, surviving on the remainder of the yolk stores that 
sustained them during their time in the egg. Soon, the time is ready for them to leave and they rise 
up into the flowing water to be carried downstream by the current. The rushing water deposits 




1 34 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


them in sleepy backwaters or calm banks. Here they burrow into the soft sediment and this is 
where they remain for the next three to seven years, safely tucked away in their muddy retreat, 
filtering the water for edible matter. Their oral hood projects from the burrow where it acts as 
a funnel to channel water through the muscular, pumping pharynx where particles of food are 
trapped in a layer of sticky mucus before being swallowed. When it is around 10 cm long, it is 
time for the larva to begin the transformation that will turn it into a young adult lamprey. This 
metamorphosis takes place in mid-summer and by the spring of the next year the juvenile may 
be ready to begin its long, arduous migration to the sea. The adult lamprey is quite a different 
beast to the larva. Gone are the delicate hood and the genteel, filter feeding way of life. In its 
place there is a carnivorous parasite with feeding apparatus straight out of a nightmare. The oral 
disk of the adult lamprey is wreathed with sharp, conical, inward curving teeth and in its mouth 
there is a rasping, muscular tongue. In the ocean, the lamprey swims with awkward undulations 
of its serpentine body, searching for suitable prey. When they locate a fish or perhaps even a 
marine mammal they latch on with their tooth-lined sucker and begin to rasp at the flesh of the 
prey. As they tear and rend the skin and muscle of the prey they secrete an anticoagulant that 
keeps the blood flowing freely. After they have gorged themselves on this highly nutritious food 
they let go to digest their meal leaving the prey with a large gaping wound, which can occasion- 
ally be fatal. After one year of this ravenous behavior they head away from the open ocean and 
back to their breeding grounds in the continental freshwater streams. Their progress is slow as 
they must fight the current and obstacles. Waterfalls can be overcome by using their oral sucker 
to cling on to the wet rocks and hoist themselves slowly through the rushing water of the cata- 
ract, As soon as they reach a suitable spot the males and female set about constructing nests in 
the gravelly bottoms of their breeding streams. They thrash their bodies around and use their 
suckers to move larger stones. After a great deal of exertion an oval depression has been formed 
into which the female sheds her eggs, closely followed by the fertilizing sperm of the male. This 
reproductive gesture is the last they make and the lampreys die soon after breeding is complete. 
The nests fill in with sand and silt carried by the current and the young, unseen, grow steadily, 
ready to begin the intriguing cycle all over again. 

♦ There are 41 known species of lamprey, 17 of which are found in North America, The 
sea lamprey is the biggest. They are found all over the world, except the high polar 
regions and the tropics. Fossils of lamprey ancestors are rare, but remains have been 
found in rocks from the early Carboniferous period, more than 320 million years old. 
It is very likely the history of these animals extends even further back into the mists 
of time, 

♦ Some lampreys, unlike the sea lamprey, are not parasitic. They develop as ammocoetes 
in the river sediment but breed straight after metamorphosis and then die. Other 
lamprey do not journey to the sea, but live out their parasitic existence in freshwater 
streams and rivers, 

♦ The skeleton of the lamprey is very simple and is composed of cartilage and not bone. 
There are vertebrae along the spine, but they are very small. The brain is small and is 
located above the blind ending channel of the single nostril. 

♦ The ravenous feeding behavior of the lampreys, particularly the larger species puts 
them into direct conflict with fishermen, who blame these animals for depleting fish 
stocks. A lamprey, latched onto a large fish will eat as much as it can at one site before 



GETTING FROM A TO B 135 


releasing its grip and attaching onto a new area. The result is a fish with large parts of 
its body stripped almost down to the bone. 

♦ The lampreys, after finding their way into the great lakes through man-made canals 
have ravaged fish stocks and numerous measures have been employed to try and stop 
them, including chemical toxins and traps,

Sloths — A cutaway of the two-toed sloth’s limbs, 
showing its specialized skeleton, adapted for 
hanging. (Mike Shanahan) 


Sloths — A captive three-toed sloth kept as a pet by 
a tribe in the Amazon. (Rhett Butler) 



Scientific name: Choloepus and Bradypus species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Pilosa 

Family: Megalonychidae and Bradypodidae 

What do they look like? Sloths are divided into two main types: two-toed and three -toed. 
These names actually refer to the number of fingers they have as all sloths actually have 
three toes. All have rounded heads and flattened faces with a doleful look. The forelimbs 
are especially long and end in 8-10 cm, curved claws. The short, fine underfur of the sloth 
is covered by a longer coat of coarse hair, giving the animal a scruffy, grizzled appearance. 
Three toed sloths are 56-60 cm in length and around 4 kg in weight, while the two-toed 
species are 58-70 cm long and weigh between 4 and 8 kg. 


1 36 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where do they live? Sloths are tree dwelling animals, preferring lowland and upland tropical 
forests up to an altitude of 2,100 m. They are found in Nicaragua, through Central America 
and as far south as northern Argentina. 

Just Hanging Around 

In the sixteenth century, early Spanish visitors to Central America were unimpressed by the 
sloth. Oviedo y Valdes wrote that he had never seen an uglier or more useless creature than the 
sloth. Granted, the sloth may not be the most beautiful animal, but it is a very successful, New 
World mammal. They have become so specialized to an arboreal, plant-eating way of life that 
there are few animals to compete with them and hardly any to eat them. They are nothing like 
those other arboreal specialists, the monkeys, who spend their days chattering and frolicking 
among the foliage. The sloths live life at a much slower pace. For most of their life they hang 
from the branches of their canopy home. Their limbs and claws are structured so that no mus- 
cular effort is needed to hold them in this position — they just hang. This slow pace of life is a 
consequence of the food they eat. Vegetation forms the bulk of their diet and to cope with this 
difficult-to-digest food the sloths have an elaborate, many chambered stomach containing cel- 
lulose digesting bacteria. The stomach is very capacious and when full it may account for about a 
third of the body weight of the mammal. Digestion, like everything else about the sloth is a slow 
process. Ingested food remains in the stomach for about a month, undergoing very slow diges- 
tion, until it passes into the short intestine. This slow process means that sloths only have to go 
to the toilet once a week and they do so, strangely, by leaving the safety of the canopy to deposit 
their feces and urine at regularly used spots at the base of trees. 

The sloths have made a success on this meager diet by living a frugal life. They move slowly and 
only when they have to and as a result their muscle mass is only 50 percent of that of a similar- 
sized mammal. They don’t waste energy by making lots of sounds. They sleep a lot, often for 
18 hours a day and their body temperature is much lower than other mammals of a similar size. 
Although the sloths have opted for a low energy life they are very successful in their for- 
est homes. In some areas, half of the mammalian energy consumption is accounted for by 
sloths and two thirds of all the mammals, by weight, are sloths. In some closely studied forests, 
8.5 sloths are found, on average in every hectare of forest. These successes are due not only 
to the sloths frugal way of life, but also its lack of predators. Only jaguars, harpy eagles and 
humans can catch and kill an adult sloth and the first can only get at them when they visit 
the ground. Humans can only shoot them, but they often hang on even when dead, making 
it difficult to retrieve the body. As protection against the harpy eagle, the sloth not only hangs 
lifeless for long periods, but is also camouflaged. The long, coarse hairs on its body have grooves 
inhabited by two species of cyanobacteria, giving the fur a greenish tinge, helping the sloth 
blend into the verdant foliage, 

♦ There are two species of two-toed sloth: Hoffman’s and Linnes and three species of 
three-toed sloth: brown throated, pale-throated, and maned. It is thought the sloths 
originated in South America about 35 million years ago. Their closest relatives are the 
armadillos and anteaters, 

♦ Today there are two genera of sloth, but the prehistoric New World was home to 

35 genera of sloth, many of which were exclusively ground dwelling animals. Some of 



GETTING FROM A TO B 137 


these animals were huge, as large as elephants, and constituted what is known as the 
American megafauna, almost all of which is now extinct. These huge sloths ranged 
from Alaska to parts of Antarctica. 

♦ The teeth of sloths do not have any enamel, making them very soft and of little use, 
except for chewing soft leaves, 

♦ Sloths give birth to a single young at a time, which has to cling to its mother for dear 
life. For a month or so the young is suckled by the mother, but after this time it begins 
eating whatever leaves it can reach. The young stays with its mother for six to nine 
months, but then it goes it alone and resides in a portion of territory left vacant by 

its mother. The type of leaves eaten by the youngster is inherited from its mother, 
enabling several sloths to cohabit in a similar home range, 

♦ Two-toed sloths have well developed canine teeth and these are often employed to 
good effect in disputes between males during the breeding season, 

♦ Only the maned sloth of south eastern Brazil is considered to be threatened due to 
the loss of its coastal rain-forest habitat. If destruction of the South American tropi- 
cal forests continues unabated then the other species may soon be threatened. 


STENUS ROVE BEETLES 



Stenus Rove Beetles — A stenus beetle uses its telescopic mouthparts to capture a springtaiL (Mike 
Shanahan) 



1 38 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Stenus species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Coleoptera 
Family: Staphylinidae 

What do they look like? These are very slender rove beetles with long legs and large, bulbous 
eyes. Typically, they are black, although some species have red spots on the wing-cases. 
Where do they live? They are found throughout the world, often in moist habitats, or in the 
vicinity of water, 

A Beetle with Tricks Galore 

The undergrowth is home to all manner of minibeasts. It is a microcosm where danger lurks 
around every corner, prowled by small but fierce predators. It is an interesting place to say the least 
and among its most intriguing residents are the Stenus rove beetles. These insects, with their large 
eyes and thin bodies can be found during daylight moving gracefully on bare patches of ground 
or on aquatic vegetation looking for small invertebrates to eat. The way they catch and subdue 
prey is unique, because when in range of an appropriate target they don’t just pounce or lunge, 
but maintain some distance between themselves and their quarry so they can employ their secret 
weapon. The lower mouthparts (the labium) of this beetle can be shot out from the head using 
blood pressure. The thin rod ends in a pad of bristly hairs and hooks and between these hairs 
are small pores, which exude an adhesive, glue-like substance that sticks the potential prey to the 
mouthparts of the beetle. The labium is then retracted, reeling in the food, bringing it in range of 
the sicklelike mandibles. This feeding strategy is particularly useful when the beetle is clambering 
around the vegetation and spies some prey, usually springtails. It is thought this amazing way of 
capturing food evolved due to the rapid reflexes of their springtail prey. The rod is so thin and can 
be shot with such speed that a springtail probably does not have sufficient time to react and hurl 
itself clear using its flexible tail. 

Springtails are not the only animals with a surprise escape mechanism, as the Stenus beetles 
also have a remarkable means of eluding danger. These beetles are so small and light they will 
often take to water, their weight supported by the surface tension. On the water, they can scull 
along using their legs at a speed of 2-3 cm per second, however, at the slightest sign of danger 
they have a surprising turn of speed thanks to a substance called stenusin produced by their anal 
gland, a droplet of which is dabbed on the surface of the water. This compound is very hydro- 
phobic, and it spreads with such force on the water the beetle is propelled forwards at a rate of 
45-70 cm per second, which is considerable for an animal less than 5 mm long. This equates 
to 90-140 body lengths in one second (600-900 km/h in human terms). It is possible for the 
beetle to do a number of these super skims before its reserve of stenusin is exhausted. 

♦ There are more species of rove beetle than any other type of beetle, with perhaps the 
exception of the weevils. Approximately 50,000 species of rove beetle have so far been 
identified, but as with many animals in this book, many more are yet to be discovered 
and named. They live in a myriad of different ways, in a huge variety of habitats. Many 
species are carnivorous, while others are herbivorous. Some are scavengers and some, 
parasitic. There are also a few specialized species, which have taken to living with ants. 



GETTING FROM A TO B 139 


♦ Rove beetles are among the few 
beetles with wing cases (elytra) 
which do not cover their abdo- 
mens. Therefore, their abdomen 
is very flexible, enabling these 
insects to exploit microhabitats 
(i.e,, tiny crevices in the soil) 
that are out of bounds to other, 
more rigid-bodied insects. This 
unusual morphology is probably 
the biggest reason why these 
insects are, arguably, the most 
successful beetles. Almost all of 
the rove beedes have wings and 
many are accomplished fliers, but 
the wings have to be folded away 
beneath the wing cases to pre- 
vent them from being damaged 
when not in use. This requires 
the skills of an origami expert to 
get the wings into the space available. 

♦ The short wing cases of the roves beetle leave the abdomen vulnerable to attack by 
predators. It is thought the lack of mechanical protection was instrumental in the 
evolution of an extensive range of compounds to deter potential predators, Stenusin is 
one such compound, and originally it may have been an odorous feeding deterrent, as 
it is known to be slightly toxic, but now its primary role is to provide an efficient way 
of evading danger or reaching land if the beetle falls into water.

STOWAWAY FALSE SCORPION 

Scientific name: Cordylochernes scorpiodes 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Pseudoscorpionida 
Family: Chernetidae 

What does it look like? This is a large, dark brown false scorpion (4-5 mm long), and it has 
the large pincers typical of this group of animals. 


^ Go Look! 

Stenus beetles can be most easily found in waterside hab- 
itats, especially where there are bare patches of ground. 
Careful searching in these habitats may yield a specimen 
or two. The normal technique for catching land crawling 
insects is to use a pit-fall trap, which involves inserting a 
small beaker into the ground and then part filling it with 
a solution of a preservative, such as a mixture of water 
and glycerol. Animals foraging on the ground will fall 
into the trap. This technique can catch Stenus beetles, 
but they have excellent grip and will often walk down the 
sides of the container, take a sniff of the fluid and trot 
back out again. Also, any beetles falling into the solution 
will be killed. A dry pitfall trap can be used, but it must 
be checked regularly for specimens. Stenus beetles can be 
kept in small humid containers and fed with springtails. 
The way in which they catch springtails can be observed 
as can their ability to skim across the water if they have 
access to a tray of water. 




140 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Stowaway False Scorpion — Stowaway false 
scorpions hitch a ride on the abdomen of a 
harlequin beetle. (Mike Shanahan) 



Stowaway False Scorpion — Note the well- developed 
pincers and the short body typical of these very 
interesting arachnids. (Ross Piper) 


Where does it live? This animal is found in Central and South America and some of the 
Caribbean islands. 

Why Walk When You Can Hitch 

Animals have evolved a huge number of ways of getting around. Some fly, some walk and some 
swim. Others, however, have perfected the art of hitchhiking, relying on other species for a ride. 
The harlequin beetle, a large, strikingly colored insect from South America is one such ride. On the 
beetles back, tucked underneath its wing covers, there are often several small false scorpions. What 
are these small arachnids doing in such a place? This story begins on a fig branch in the South 
American rain forest. Inside these branches live the larvae of the harlequin beetle, feeding on the 
wood. Scuttling around on the log are false scorpions feeding on small invertebrates, which they 
dispatch with their pincers. The population of false scorpions on the log may grow to a size where 
there is insufficient space and food; therefore, a new branch needs to be found, but how? These 
animals are very small and finding a new home in the vastness of the forest is made even more dif- 
ficult by the fact they don’t have wings. Fortunately, the solution to their problem is beneath their 
feet as the harlequin beetle larvae have completed their development and they are ready to emerge 
as adults from the branch. As soon as the adult beetle is fully out of its tunnel, the false scorpions 
gather around its rear end and nip its abdomen with their pincers. Annoyed by these pinches, 
the beetle flexes it rear, making enough space beneath its wing cases and wings for the little 
arachnids to jump aboard. A large male false scorpion will prevent other males from boarding the 
beetle, but will happily allow females on, in the hope of fathering their young when they reach 
their destination. In total, there may be as more than 30 false scorpion passengers on one beetle. 
The beetle takes off from the branch that nurtured it, along with its arachnid stowaways. Eventu- 
ally, the beetle will land on a suitable branch and the passengers will disembark. The bullying male 
who shepherded the females will not father all of the young the females produce as they stored 
sperm from previous matings with the males who were left behind on their old branch. 

♦ False scorpions are amazing animals, but due to their small size they are often 
overlooked. They are rarely more than 8 mm in length and many species are much 
smaller. Over 2,000 species have been described throughout the world, but due 
to their size and secretive habits, it is highly likely that many more species are yet 



GETTING FROM A TO B 141 


to be identified. Although 
they are rarely seen, false scor- 
pions are actually very common 
and a single square meter of 
ground can be home to several 
hundred individuals. 

♦ They have the name false scor- 
pion or pseudoscorpion because of 
their similarity to their relatives, 
the true scorpions. Unlike the 
true scorpions, however, these 
animals lack a sting-bearing tail. 

Like the true scorpions, they 
do have a well-formed pair of 
pincers, from which long sensory 
hairs project. Venom is produced 
by glands in the pincers and is 
used for subduing the prey of 
these animals (all pseudoscorpi- 
ons are carnivorous). Silk can also be produced by the pincers, 

♦ Like other arachnids, pseudoscorpions must shed their skin in order to grow. To do 
this, some species construct a small silken igloo, which keeps them safe during this 
very vulnerable time, 

♦ Reproduction in these animals depends on the male producing a small sperm-filled 
stalk (spermatophore), which he sticks to the ground. He must then dance’ with the 
female and lead her over his stalk. A substance in the female’s genital tract makes 
the sperm mass swell up, helping the male’s gametes into the body of his mate, 

♦ Using their pincers to get a grip, false scorpions use a whole range of large flies, wasps 
and beetles to get from A to B.

^ Go Look! 

Sometimes, if you look under a stone, log or piece of 
bark, you may be lucky and see a false scorpion. Nor- 
mally, more searching is required and the best way to 
see one of these animals is to collect some leaf litter and 
take it home, where it can be placed in a device to tease 
these arachnids from their hiding places (a Berlese fun- 
nel). The leaf litter can be placed in a large, mesh-lined 
funnel and exposed to the heat and light given off by a 
desk lamp. The animals in the leaf litter attempt to move 
away from the heat and light and so keep moving further 
down through the plant debris until eventually they fall 
through the mesh and into a collecting container. Any 
false scorpions found can be watched and released, but 
it is possible to keep them, as long as they have a supply 
of food, such as springtails. One species of false scorpion 
( Chelifer cancroides) can even be found in houses where it 
often feeds on book lice.

geckos. Males, the larger of the two sexes, can be up to 40 cm long and weigh as much 300 g.

Tokay Gecko — The foot of the tokay gecko with insets showing the microscopic arrangement of bristles 
and their feathery ends. (Mike Shanahan) 


Their body is flattened and the head is rather large with striking eyes. The big mouth is 
normally agape in what can only be described as a grin. Not only are they large geckos, but 
tokays are also very boldly patterned. They have small red/ orange blotches all over their 
body against a background or green/blue. 

Where does it live? The native range of these animals extends from India to New Guinea, 
including much of Southeast Asia. They are forest dwellers and can be found scrambling up 
the trunks of rain forest trees or scrambling around on rock faces. 


Get a Grip! 

The tokay gecko, with its large size, fierce temperament and distinctive call is one of the most 
familiar of the all the geckos. Like many geckos it has an amazing ability. With apparent ease it 
can clamber around on vertical surfaces or even upside down. No animal can really touch them 
for sure-footedness and for many, many years, the secret of their death defying stunts was a 
complete mystery. All that people could see for sure were what looked like tiny treads on the 
underside of the lizard’s digits. Some people thought these little flaps were acting like little suc- 
tion cups, enabling the gecko to stick to even the most slippery of surfaces. This was disproved 
when it was shown that even in a vacuum the lizard remains firmly attached. If the treads on the 
digits were sucking the animal on to a vertical pane of glass they would quickly become useless in 
a vacuum. Other people thought the gecko’s secret was some adhesive produced by glands in the 
feet, in the same way a fly appears to mock the laws of physics by scuttling with poise on a ceiling. 
It was reasoned an adhesive would spread through the tread-like structures giving a large surface 
area of stickiness when the foot was planted. This too, turned out to be incorrect. The feet of 
geckos have no specialized glands for the production of an adhesive. Finally, in the year 2000, 
some scientists finally unraveled the gecko’s mystery. Using very powerful microscopes they were 


GETTING FROM A TO B 143 


able to look in minute detail at the underside of a gecko foot. What they saw was row-upon-row 
of tiny flat hairs — 2 million of them on a single toe. Cranking the electron microscope up to 
near the limits of its abilities, they were able to zoom in on the tips of these hairs. The end of ear 
hair branched out into hundreds of thousands of microscopic spoon-shaped structures, which 
the scientists likened to a florets of broccoli. These tiny structures are applied to the surface on 
which the gecko is walking and being so small they can be pressed right up against the fissures, 
lumps, and holes that are invisible to the naked eye of a human. Their contact with the surface is 
so intimate that can actually latch onto the molecular binding forces present in all the substances 
they walk on. The force they are exploiting is known as van der Waals force and although it is 
very weak and essentially invisible to us, there are enough tiny little spatulas on the gecko’s feet 
to provide an excellent grip. The grip is so strong the reptile can hold all of its weight on one toe, 
but when it wants to lift its foot away from the surface all it has to do is roll its digits upward, 
thus breaking each of the microscopic attractions. Even more impressive is the fact this sticki- 
ness never grows weak. The hairs on the gecko’s feet are self cleaning. Any dirt on the hairs is 
more strongly attracted to the surface the lizard is walking on rather than its feet. This incredible 
ability has given some people inspiration for a whole new generation of adhesives that are very 
strong and can be used over and over again. 

♦ There more than 800 species of gecko. The largest species is only known from one 
stuffed specimen found in a museum basement in Marseille, France, It is known as 
Delcourt’s gecko and an adult specimen was at least 60 cm long. It was native to New 
Zealand, but like much of the native fauna of this island it became extinct at the end 
of the nineteenth century. The smallest gecko is a mere 16 mm long, small enough to 
curl up on a dime. This species, the Jaragua Sphaero, was only discovered in 2001 on a 
small island off the coast of the Dominican Republic. 

♦ The name tokay comes from the distinctive call this gecko makes. 

♦ Although the tokay gecko is an impressive beast it doesn’t make good pet. It is the 
most aggressive gecko and any attempt to handle them is usually met with its snap- 
ping jaws, Their bite can be painful and once attached they have a reluctance to relin- 
quish their grip. 

♦ All geckos are carnivorous, although some species supplement their diet with fruit, 
nectar and sap. 

♦ As many species of gecko are naturally found on rocky outcrops, where their amaz- 
ing climbing ability comes in very useful, they are more than at home around human 
dwellings as they climb around the walls and ceilings. Several species of gecko have 
become house specialists as their favored food, insects, are drawn to the lights around 
human dwellings, 

♦ There are at least 12 species of gecko that reproduce without the need for a male. 
These parthenogenetic species are represented by females only as sperm isn’t required 
to fertilize the eggs. 

♦ The clutch size of geckos is small, the typical number of eggs being two. The small 
species, possibly due to their tiny bodies are restricted to one egg at a time.

WHITE WORM LIZARD 



White Worm Lizard — A white worm lizard 
raises its tail and head off the ground to 
confuse predators as to which end is its head. 
(Mike Shanahan) 



White Worm Lizard — A white worm lizard 
removed from its subterranean lair. The grooves, 
encircling its body and giving it the appearance of a 
large worm, are clearly visible. (Laurie J. Vitt) 


Scientific name: Amphisbaena alba 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Amphisbaenidae 

What does it look like? Amongst amphisbaenians, the white worm lizard is one of the largest 
species reaching a length of approximately 72 cm. The animal is commonly yellowish-white, 
although a great deal of variation in color exists. 

Where does it live? This species has a wide distribution across central and northern South 
America and occurs on some islands in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad. It is found both in 
forested (e,g,, Amazon rain forest) and open (e.g., Cerrado of Brazil and Llanos of Venezuela) 
areas and is often associated with leaf-cutter ants. 

The Subterranean Life of a Legless Lizard 

The white worm lizard spends almost all of its time below ground and on the island of Trinidad, 
they have occasionally been found in the deep galleries of leaf-cutter ant nests, particularly the 
garbage tips, where the ants deposit their waste and their dead. What are the reptiles doing in 
these subterranean rubbish tips? They are looking for food. This reptile seems to be particularly 
partial to the larvae of a large beetle ( Coelosis biloba), which feeds on waste and detritus in the 
ant’s rubbish pile safe from most predators, but the worm lizard with its long, thin body and 
tunneling abilities can easily find these plump grubs. The relationship between the worm lizard 
and beetle also involves a small parasitic crustacean, known as a tongue worm. These live in the 
respiratory tract of the worm lizard, its definitive host. To infect the reptile it must use another 
animal, the intermediate host, in this case the beetle grub. The tongue worm’s eggs are found in 



GETTING FROM A TO B 145 


the feces of the worm lizard, which the beetle grub inadvertently ingests. The worm lizard then 
devours the infected beetle larva reinfecting itself with the tongue worm parasite and the cycle 
is complete! 

The white worm lizard is a large animal, so before long it may exhaust the supply of beetle 
larvae in one leaf-cutter ant nest and have to search for more larvae in other nests. To do this 
it leaves its familiar subterranean habitat and heads for the surface. Due to its fossorial nature, 
the animals eyesight is almost nonexistent, so it must employ an alternative sense to find an- 
other ant nest. It uses its acute sense of smell to detect the pheromone trails left by worker leaf- 
cutter ants as they forage along the forest floor. These trails are markers for their nest mates to 
follow and they indicate the way back to the nest. The reptile finds and follows one of these trails 
to its source. It enters the nest and makes for one of refuse tips deep underground to continue its 
search for the fat beetle grubs, 

♦ Approximately 140 species of worm lizards are known, distributed across tropical and 
subtropical regions of the globe. Consequently, most are in the southern hemisphere, 
A single species occurs in the United States and only one occurs in Europe, They 
range in size from 9-12 cm to the 70 cm white worm lizard and they are all superbly 
adapted to a fossorial way of life, rarely venturing to the surface, although rainfall and 
flooding will force one of these animals from its burrow. Due to their secretive way of 
life, very little is known about them. It is likely that many more species remain to be 
discovered. 

♦ The body of the worm lizard displays a number of amazing features, some of which 
are adaptations to a subterranean lifestyle. As in other, fossorial animals, many of 
the bones of the skull are fused, making it particularly strong for ramming a tunnel 
through the soil. Some species have a spade shaped head for compacting tunnel walls 
by moving their head up and down, while others have a keel shaped head used to 
compact their tunnels with a side-to-side motion. Many species have a bullet shaped 
head used to forge a tunnel through the soil. Also, the skin of a worm lizard is very 
loosely attached to its body, enabling the animal to ‘slide’ through its integument. This 
helps the worm lizard move backward just as well as it can move forwards, which is 
important in the confines of a tunnel. 

♦ The Latin name Amphisbaena means to “move in both ways” reflecting the animal’s 
ability to move forward and backward equally well. Also, the term amphisbaena is 
used to describe a venomous creature of myth and legend, said to have a head at both 
ends of its body. Interestingly, when a worm lizard is on the surface and finds itself 
threatened it will raise both ends of its body toward the sky. This defensive posture 
confuses the predator as to which is the real head. The head end with its powerful 
jaws is capable of inflicting a powerful and painful bite, 

♦ The vast majority of worm lizards are completely legless. However, one peculiar group 
has retained its front legs, which are strong and molelike, an obvious adaptation for 
burrowing. 

♦ The benign appearance of the worm lizard belies its voracious, predatory ways. They 
will eat any animal they find in their tunnels and will even make forays to the surface 
to forage for suitable prey. Their dentition is unique, with two large teeth in the upper 
jaw and one in the lower jaw, meshing together to form an effective pair of pincers. 



146 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The reproductive habits of worm lizards, like many other aspects of their lives, are 
very poorly known, but some species lay eggs, while others give birth to live young. 
The white worm lizard lays 8-16 eggs, primarily during the tropical dry season. 
Nothing is known of their population densities as they are so difficult to find. The 
worm lizards are, without doubt, among the most enigmatic land animals.

BEE WOLF 



Bee Wolf — A female bee wolf carrying a 
honeybee at the entrance to her elaborate 
nest. (Mike Shanahan) 



Bee Wolf — An exceptional, close-up image of an 
adult female bee wolf. (Roger Key) 


Scientific names Philanthus triangulum 
Scientific classifications

Familys Sphecidae 

What does it look like? Superficially, the bee wolf resembles a common wasp as it has the same 
color pattern (black and yellow) and is approximately the same size. 

Where does it live? The bee wolf is found in habitats with sparse, short vegetation where 
the soil is sufficiently sandy to allow digging. The climate is also a crucial prerequisite as 



148 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


bee wolves need comparatively dry summers and occur mostly in places with less than 
700 mm rain per year. This insect is distributed from Spain in the west to Afghanistan in 
the east, and from Norway in the north to South Africa in the south. This is about the same 
distribution as their prey, the (western) honeybee. 

The Lengths a Mother Will Go To 

Many of the bees and wasps go to great lengths to make sure their young have the best possible 
start in life. The bee wolf is a perfect example of this as the female goes to great lengths to provi- 
sion her nest with food for the next generation. The adult female feeds on nectar and pollen to 
provide her with the energy needed for flight, but to provide for her young, she must stalk and 
capture unfortunate honeybees. Her prey is often distracted gathering nectar and pollen from 
flowers, and upon sighting suitable quarry, she flies straight toward the honeybee and knocks 
it from its flower. On the way toward the ground, the bee wolf stings the honeybee in the weak 
membrane joining the plates of its thorax, injecting a paralyzing venom. While the honeybee is 
tangled in the vegetation or wrestling on the ground, the venom acts quickly, and when the prey 
is safely immobilized, the bee wolf grabs it with her middle legs and takes off back to her nest. 
The nest of the bee wolf is a lavish affair. The subterranean lair is dug in sandy soil by the 
female using her front legs and mandibles. The tunnel can be as much as 1 m long, a considerable 
distance for an animal that is no more than 16 mm in length. The first part of the tunnel slopes 
downward at an angle of 30°, after which there is a long horizontal section. Up to 34 lateral 
tunnels ending in a brood chamber are excavated horizontally on each side of the main tunnel. 
The female bee wolf stocks each brood chamber with one to six paralyzed honeybees and a 
single egg that hatches into a hungry larva. The bees are smeared with a secretion from glands on 
the female’s head, and only recently has the reason for this behavior been discovered. The nest 
of the bee wolf is warm and humid — a great place for the growth of fungi and bacteria — and 
without some means of preservation, the larva of the bee wolf would be left with little more than 
a mound of rotting insects. The secretions of the bee wolf act like embalming fluid and smooth 
all the tiny nooks and crannies on the bee’s body that offer a great place for the condensation 
of water. Without these minute condensation nuclei, droplets of water cannot form on the bee 
and its body stays dry — protected from the ravages of bacteria and fungi, which require mois- 
ture to survive. Not only this, but the female bee wolf also secretes a whitish substance from its 
antennae that contains symbiotic bacteria. These bacteria are taken up by the larvae and spun 
into the walls of the cocoon when it is preparing to pupate. The bacteria protect the pupa from 
potentially harmful fungi, especially during the long period of hibernation. 

With the brood chamber fully stocked the female daubs the white bacteria paste from her 
antennae on the ceiling of the chamber. The chamber is then sealed. The white microorganism 
marker left by the female indicates where her fully developed offspring should dig to escape from 
the brood chamber. This is important, as the entrance of the chamber was filled in by the female, 
as was the outer entrance. The fully developed wasp cannot depend on light to orientate itself, so 
the marker prevents it from wasting time looking for the nest exit in the wrong place. 

♦ The bee wolf larvae hatching from the eggs have a voracious appetite. In less than two 
weeks, they consume all of the food left by their mother. Ready to pupate, they spin 
themselves a bottle-shaped silken cocoon, which is attached at its thin end to the wall 
of the chamber. 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 49 


♦ A single bee wolf female can stock its nest with well over 100 honeybees. In many 
areas of their range, they are the only animal preying specifically on the honeybee, 

♦ The substances found in the head gland secretions of the bee wolf are potent anti- 
microbial agents, and they are being actively investigated as starting points for new 
types of antifungal and antibacterial compounds. It is possible that many wasp species 
produce substances like the ones produced by the bee wolf. Since they often store 
food in nests for long periods of time, the prevention of decay is very important. 

♦ There are close relatives of the bee wolf that specialize in preying on other insects. 
One interesting species hunts weevils on the ground or in short vegetation, while 
another hunts flies, which are paralyzed with venom before being flown back to the 
nest after being impaled on the female wasp’s stinger, 

♦ In the United Kingdom, this species was once thought to be very rare and was known 
to inhabit only a handful of sites in the south of the country. In recent years, however, 
the range of the animal has exploded, and it can now be found in suitable sites in 

all of southern England, which is bad news for honeybees! It is thought that this 
range expansion is direct evidence of global warming. The vast majority of insects are 
warmth loving and will therefore respond to even slight increases in temperature.

BLUE WHALE 




Blue Whale — An adult blue whale compared in size to a pick-up truck. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Balaenoptera musculus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Cetacea 
Family: Balaenopteridae 

What does it look like? This is a huge animal with an elegant, tapering body topped off with a 
snoutlike rostrum and ending in a large tail fluke. It is a mottled blue color with a yellowish 



1 50 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


underside. The massive mouth can be made even more cavernous thanks to a series of long 
pleats along the throat. 

Where does it live? The blue whale is found in all the world’s oceans. Outside the breeding 
season, they are found in the high latitudes of their feeding grounds, but in the breeding 
season, the females swim to tropical and subtropical regions in order to give birth. 

Milk Makes You Big and Strong 

The blue whale has to be included in this book for the simple reason that it is so massive. There 
are frequent claims from fossil hunters that the dinosaurs and their kin could have attained 
huge proportions, but it is very doubtful that any animal has ever exceeded the unbelievable 
bulk of this mammal. The blue whale starts its life as a calf, 9 m in length and a hefty 3 tonnes 
in weight — the same weight as a fully grown hippopotamus. Even from birth the race is on to 
amass the great weight of the adult, and so the calf begins suckling in earnest, swallowing around 
200 L of milk per day. The term milk is used loosely as the substance produced by the mammary 
glands of the female is more like runny cheese and contains 35-50 percent fat. On this highly 
nutritious diet, the calf grows faster than any other young animal. Every day, its weight increases 
by 90 kg (4 kg every hour), and its length by 4 cm. The female cannot sustain this level of guz- 
zling indefinitely as her weight plummets by about 50 tons during the suckling period. At seven 
months old, the calf is weaned off the milk onto the adult diet of the small shrimp known as krill. 
Even at the tender age of seven months, the calf is 16 m long and weighs 23 tons. This is also the 
time when the females and calves part company, but both head back to the feeding grounds in 
the northern or southern latitudes where the red krill can be found in immense swarms. 

Blue whale feeding is far from subtle. They simply swim through these crustacean clouds and 
open their mouth as they near the surface, gulping up thousand of liters of water and millions of 
the small crustaceans. To maintain its huge bulk, the whale needs gigantic helpings. It has been 
calculated that an adult blue whale requires at least 1.5 million calories a day (a human needs 
2,500), but as they only feed intensively for part of the year, this figure is more like 3 million calories 
a day. This energy requirement translates into 40 million little crustaceans per day, or something on 
the order of 4 tons. At any one time, the whales stomach can hold between 1 and 2 tons of krill! 

Even after its initial growth spurt, the blue whale continues to grow rapidly, A female reaches 
sexual maturity at the age of five, at which point she is around 24 m long. Fully grown, the females 
are around 2 m longer than the males, and the size they can attain is a contentious subject. The 
most reliable measurement is for a female caught by Japanese whalers in the 1946-47 season. 
She was 29.9 m long, but it is almost certain that the biggest specimens were caught a long time 
before this, A length of well over 30 m is certainly within the realms of possibility. Weight is 
even more difficult to estimate. It is exceptionally difficult to weigh a marine animal of this size. 
The only measurements come from the days of whaling when they were butchered on shore and 
each piece was weighed separately, giving weights of 160-190 tons — the same as about 26 fully 
grown African elephants. These numbers did not take into account the blood and other fluids 
that were lost when the animal was cut up. It is likely that the largest blue whales weighed more 
than 200 tons — considerably more than a fully laden Boeing 737. 

♦ The family of whales to which the blue whale belongs includes five other species: fin 
whale, sei whale, humpback whale, Bryde’s whale, and minke whale. They all have the 
long throat pleats that make the mouth roomier during feeding gulps. There is still 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 151 


a great deal to learn about these animals because, although they are so huge, these 
whales swim fast and range over thousands of square kilometers of ocean, making it 
difficult to find and study them. 

♦ All of these whales feed in the same way, trapping huge quantities of food-laden water 
in their bulging mouth and using their massive, elephant-sized tongue to squeeze 

the water through hanging fringes of baleen plates — made from keratin, the same 
material found in mammalian nails and hair. The baleen acts like a sieve and traps the 
food as the water is squeezed out. 

♦ The vital statistics of the blue whale are mind-boggling. Much of its great weight 
is blubber and muscle. The skeleton is actually quite simple and light. The heart 
is as big as small car, pumping blood around lungs weighing more than 1 ton. The 
lung capacity is probably on the order of 2,000 L; compare this to the 4-5 L for an 
average human. Used air is expelled, as a high-pressure cloud of carbon dioxide and 
water vapor, over 9 m into the air when they surface to breathe through a nostril 
wide enough for a toddler to crawl through. The blue whale, like other large marine 
mammals is a very efficient breather. Each time it breathes, 80-90 percent of the air 
in its lungs is exchanged, compared to only 10-15 percent for mammals like humans. 

♦ Not only is the blue whale the largest animal, it is also the loudest. The sounds 
they produce are very low-frequency and beyond the range of human hearing, but 
they have been measured at around 190 decibels. Sound travels very well through 
water, and these very loud moans are probably audible for thousands of miles. It is 
possible that populations of blue whales separated by thousands of miles of ocean 
can communicate with one another. These sounds were only detected in the 1950s, 
when military hydrophones were installed beneath the waves to listen for enemy 
submarines. It was only in the 1960s that these sounds were found to be coming from 
blue and fin whales. The complete function of these sounds is not fully understood. 

♦ During the early years of commercial whaling, the blue whales were nothing but a 
majestic sight for the hunters with their sailing ships and hand-held harpoons. They 
were too fast to be caught, and even if they could be caught and killed, their corpses 
would sink. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century when various enter- 
prising Scandinavians devised the means of pursuing, killing, and keeping hold of these 
gigantic animals that the whalers could turn their attention to the blue whale. With 
the tools at their disposal, the whalers set about hunting the blue whales remorselessly. 
The slaughter is startling and peaked in the season of 1930-31 when more than 
28,000 blue whales were killed. In total, well over 350,000 were killed and butchered 
in the whaling years, and 90 percent of these were taken in Antarctic waters. Today, 

a few thousand blue whales survive. The huge population of blue whales in Antarctic 
waters probably numbered 250,000 animals, but by 1963, it was found to number 
no more than 2,000 individuals. Fortunately, this plight ensured their protection, and 
today, the populations in some areas are increasing, but other small groups have been 
lost forever. As whaling targeted the largest animals, the individuals in the oceans 
today are far below the maximum attainable size of this whale, and it will be many, 
many decades before the oceans are once again graced by truly immense blue whales.

BURYING BEETLES 



Burying Beetles — A pair of burying beetles tend to their young on the small mammal corpse 
they have smoothed to a ball. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Nicrophorus species 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Coleoptera 
Family: Silphidae 

What do they look like? These medium to large beetles are 15-30 mm in length. They are 
black, and many have orange markings on the wing cases, which do not cover the full length 
of the abdomen. The head is large, with bulbous eyes and a pair of clubbed antennae. The 
legs are long and sturdy. 

Where do they live? These beetles are found in various undisturbed habitats, including 
coniferous and deciduous woodlands, open grasslands, and marshes. They are animals 
of temperate and alpine areas, and there are also some species in North Africa. 

Nature’s Grave Diggers 

The burying beetles are accomplished scavengers, and they are some of the most dedicated parents 

in the insect world. To breed, they must locate the body of a dead animal, such as a small bird or 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 53 


mammal, which they accomplish by scent. They are attracted to these corpses by the smell of decay 
which they sense using their antenna. These odors can be detected over long distances, up to 8 km, 
and as soon as the beetle gets a whiff of them, it takes to the air and flies to the source. Should a 
male beetle locate a corpse and find a female of his species already there, the two will mate, but if 
there is no female, he will adopt a posture on top of the carcass and emit a sex pheromone to attract 
a mate. Other burying beetles will also be attracted to the carcass, but a newly mated couple will 
have to repel them. The pair must work quickly to hide the body before other animals are attracted 
to it. They eagerly burrow around and beneath the body, excavating a small pit, which the animal 
eventually drops in to, disappearing from view and sometimes descending up to 60 cm in to the 
ground. With the carcass hidden in the confines of the burial chamber, the female deposits her eggs 
in the soil just above the dead body. Both beetles climb all over the small dead body, removing fur 
or feathers and smoothing it until it looks like a featureless lump of matter. Before the eggs hatch, 
the prospective parents nibble a hole in the corpse and coat the resulting pit with a substance from 
their anal glands. The larvae emerge from their eggs and are attracted by the odor of the small dead 
animal and head straight for the main burial chamber, where they climb on to the carcass to begin 
feeding in the little pit excavated by the male and female. The parents feed the larvae with chewed 
up flesh, a behavior that is a necessity in some species as the larvae cant survive otherwise. In other 
species, the larvae are able to feed by themselves with a little help from their parents. The male 
and female will also kill some of their offspring if there is not enough food to go around. The larvae 
feed voraciously and grow rapidly until the carcass provisioned by the parents is just a pile of bones. 
Fully grown, the larvae leave the remains of their larval food and burrow into the surrounding soil 
where they pupate, to emerge the next season as adults, thus completing the cycle, 

♦ There are approximately 75 species of Nicrophorus burying beetles worldwide. Along with 
their close relatives, they specialize in locating and using the dead bodies of small animals. 
They are thought to be closely related to the rove beetles, many of which are also attracted 
to the bodies of dead animals, but only to feed on the other insects they find there, 

♦ As with animal dung, animal carcasses are precious resources, representing an abun- 
dance of organic matter that can be used by a bewildering variety of organisms. The 
supply of small corpses is not predictable; therefore, the animals that use them must 
be able to detect the faintest sign of one and get to it as quickly as possible. The bury- 
ing beetles will not only have to compete with others of their own kind but also with 
other beetles, flies, bacteria, and fungi. Other beetles can be chased away, the eggs 

of flies can be removed from the carcass, but bacteria and fungi present a different 
problem. They are too small to be chased off or removed, but the beetles have a secret 
weapon to deal with these microorganisms. It is thought the anal secretion of these bee- 
tles contains substances that prevent or stop the growth of bacteria and fungi. This is 
essential to ensure that the flesh of the corpse is not spoiled before the burying beetle’s 
offspring get a chance to feed. 

♦ These beetles often have very bold, orange markings on their wing cases. This is known 
as aposematic coloration and is a warning to predators that the animal displaying the 
bright pattern either tastes disgusting or has a painful sting. Many insects broadcast 
their defenses in such a way. The burying beetle’s defense is its distastefulness, 

♦ Like many large, flying insects, burying beetles are often used for transport by mites. 

These mites cling to the flanks or underside of the beetle, shunning the light, and will 



154 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


move over the beetle as one large group, 
resembling an orange patch sliding over 
the insect. Exactly what these mites do is 
unknown. They are obviously associated 
with the burying beetle, as all individuals 
carry them. It is possible they live in the 
nest of the burying beetle feeding on the 
scraps left by the larvae and get into a 
new nest by hitching a ride. 

♦ Few insects demonstrate the level of 
parental care shown by the burying 
beetles. Even more remarkable is the 
involvement of the male. The males of 
almost all insects have nothing to do 
with their young.

These beetles are rarely seen, but they are common, and 
there are several ways in which they can be found. The 
first method is a light trap, which is typically used to at- 
tract moths. As the burying beetles are mainly active after 
dark and probably orientate themselves by the moon, a 
light trap can be used to lure them. The trap, consisting of 
a special, bright bulb and collecting box, can be set up in 
various habitats, such as woodlands, open areas, or scrub, 
and left running throughout the night. In the morning, 
the trap can be opened, and at the bottom, there may be 
some burying beetles. If you pick the beetles up, you will 
notice their very pungent odor, which potential predators 
must find unpleasant. Look closely at the beetle, and you 
will see the mites that scuttle all over its body. Burying 
beetles are active animals and strong fliers, and as soon as 
they are released, they will take flight. 

Another way to catch burying beetles is by using a small 
pitfall trap baited with meat, such as chicken or fish. The 
beetle will smell the decaying meat and fly to its source, 
eventually ending up in the plastic container you have par- 
tially buried in the ground* The trap should be checked 
regularly so that any captured animals can be released.

Scientific name: Agaonids 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Agaonidae 

What do they look like? Fig wasps are small insects. The females are winged with flat heads, 
while the males are wingless with pale, relatively soft bodies. 

Where do they live? These insects are found in tropical and subtropical areas, always in 
association with fig trees. 

Close Ties 

Figs are a spectacularly successful group of flowering plants, numbering about 900 species, many 
of which dominate tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Fundamental to the success of this group of 
plants is the unique way in which they are pollinated. A flower is an advertisement for pollinators, 
typically insects. The shape of the flower normally gives it away, but with the figs, the flowers develop 
inside the growths coveted by humans and other animals as food. What could be the pollinator in 
this very odd arrangement? Over millions of years, the life of the fig tree and the life of a number of 
small wasps have become inextricably entwined. The majority of fig trees have their own dedicated 
species of tiny pollinating wasp that fertilize the bounteous fruit of a fig tree (a single fig tree may 
produce up to 1 million figs). These wasps are so small they could easily crawl through the eye of 
a small needle. The development of the figs on one particular tree is often synchronized, and 
when they are young and small, they give off a particular odor that attracts females of its pollina- 
tor wasp from far and wide. The wasp, after following this scent to its source, alights and enters 
the fig through a small hole surrounded by scales — a wasp turnstile that admits only the right 
pollinator species. It is a tight squeeze, and the female tears off her wings and antennae as she 
squeezes along the tunnel, inching her way along with backward pointing teeth on her head 
and limbs. This is often a one-way ticket — she may never leave the fig once she has fought her 
way inside. The fig is actually a thick-walled chamber, the sides of which sprout tiny flowers. In 
some fig species, there may be only female flowers in the chamber, whereas other species always 
have male and female flowers in the same fig. Many female fig wasps have a pouch on their un- 
derbelly that stores pollen taken from the fig they developed in. The female pollinates the female 
flowers, diligently sprinkling a few grains on each flower visited and laying eggs in some of them, 
threading her egg-laying tube into the thin neck of the bloom. This is her final act, and she dies 
soon after, A month passes, and some of the fig flowers are ruptured by the escape of the female 
wasp’s first offspring. These are all males, and they are pallid and wingless. They crawl around 
the fig chamber with heavy heads and well-developed limbs. Their first act is to mate with their 
sisters that are still developing in some of the other flowers of the fig. The male wasps then use 
their well-developed mandibles to chop a tunnel from the chamber toward the surface of the 
fig. Sadly for the males, their life in the dim half-light of the fig chamber is short, and when 
the excavations are complete, they grow weary and die. Shortly after, the female wasps emerge, 
with their own young already developing inside them. They work their way around the chamber, 
either carefully collecting pollen from the male flowers that have sprouted or being accidentally 
dusted by the pollen. Using the hole chewed by the males to escape, they then fly away from their 
birth fig. The heady tropical air will be thick with all manner of odors, yet only one will grab the 



156 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


attention of the freshly emerged females, and that is the scent given off by one species of develop- 
ing fig as it signals its readiness to its dedicated pollinator. 

♦ The relationship between the wasp and the fig tree has been at least 80 million years 
in the making. It is one of the closest in nature. Neither the fig nor the wasp can live 
without one another, 

♦ The finer points of this complex relationship are still to be understood. It appears that 
some species of fig tree are pollinated by more than one species of fig wasp. 

♦ Any self-respecting lazy wasp would take advantage of the refuge for its young 
provided by the fig without returning the favor and pollinating the plant. After all, 
the wasp has to go to a lot of trouble to actively pollinate the fig. What stops the wasp 
from cheating? It has been found that unfertilized figs can be more likely to fall from 
the tree than fertilized ones and that this would spell the end for the offspring of 
any cheating gall wasps. Even if the unpollinated figs do not fall, it is likely they will 
produce fewer wasp offspring. 

♦ These tiny insects and their role as the sole pollinators of fig trees make them a key 
component of tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Countless animals rely on fig trees, 
not only for their nutritious fruit but also for the habitats they provide. After the 
female fig wasps have emerged, the seeds develop and the whole fig ripens, becoming 
attractive to birds, monkeys, and a raft of other tropical animals. 

♦ As with any other relationship on the planet, the fig/ fig wasp symbiosis is exploited 
by various other animals. There are many other species of wasp that prey on the fig 
wasps. The females of these parasitic wasps have long, needle-like ovipositors, which 
they use to introduce their eggs into the developing larvae of the fig wasps. They 
perch on the outside of the fig, and with the accuracy of a sniper, pick out the fig wasp 
larvae in the multitude of fig flowers using the sensitive tip of their ovipositor.

KING COBRA 

Scientific name: Ophiophagus hannah 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Elapidae 

What does it look like? Fully grown king cobras can reach almost 6 m in length, although the 
typical size is more like 3-4 m. Their color varies, and adults can be yellow, brown, green, or 
black. The adult’s underside is typically light in color and sometimes sports dark bars. The 
youngsters are black with light-colored bars on their head and body.

King Cobra — A female king cobra rearing up to warn 
intruders away from her nest. (Mike Shanahan) 



King Cobra — Here, the world’s largest venomous 
snake adopts a threatening posture by rearing up 
and flattening its neck into the distinctive hood. 
(Rhett Butler) 


Where does it live? The king cobra is found throughout much of India, and its range extends into 
southern China, Malaysia, and the Philippines, It is essentially a forest animal, preferring tree 
cover, bamboo thickets, and mangrove swamps. It has been found in mountainous regions at 
altitudes in excess of 2,000 m. It is often found near water, 

A Dedicated and Venomous Nest Guardian 

As its name implies, the king cobra is a very majestic beast. It is the largest venomous snake 
by far, and because of its size and fearsome appearance, it has always been surrounded with 
superstition and is rather legendary in its native range. Although the king cobra does not have 
the most potent venom of all the snakes, it more than makes up for that with the huge volumes 
of venom it can inject in a single strike. The sheer quantity of venom an adult king cobra injects 
through its 10 mm fangs is enough to bring down a fully grown Asian elephant, or to put it 
another way, 20-30 adult humans. The toxin affects the nervous system of the victim, quickly 
causing respiratory failure. Even with its nasty nip, the king cobra is not an aggressive snake. 
Only when it is feeding or feeling threatened will it resort to using its venom. At other times, it 
slips quietly into the undergrowth out of the way of approaching trouble. The only time a king 
cobra will stand its ground is when it is guarding its nest, as females in particular are dedicated 
parents. The nest is quite an impressive structure especially for an animal without limbs of any 
kind. Using the coils of her long body the female scoops up leaf litter to make a mound into 
which she deposits a clutch of 20-40 eggs. The mound of rotting plant material acts like an 
incubator speeding the development of the embryos within their leathery shells. During this 
time, the female is a very attentive mother, staying on or near the mound for the whole incuba- 
tion period. Any trespasser is treated to an impressive defensive display The female rears up 
until her head may be almost 2 m off the ground. Her neck flattens into a hood, and she emits 
a high-pitched hiss. 

The male may also help guard the nest, but this is rare and only extends to him loitering in the 
vicinity The female may be a tenacious guard of the nest, a behavior almost unknown in snakes, 
but as soon as the young writhe from their shells, they have to fend for themselves in the big, 
wide world with its many dangers. For the first part of their lives, the young snakes consume any 



158 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


prey they can get their elastic jaws around, but as they grow, so do their prey items. The favored 
prey of an adult king cobra is other snakes. Rat snakes are often taken, but pythons up to around 
3 m in length may be subdued and eaten. 

♦ The king cobra injects an impressive amount of venom, but it is less than that injected 
by the gaboon viper, a thickset snake of sub-Saharan Africa. The gaboon viper also 
has the longest fangs of any snake (up to 5 cm!) 

♦ Snake venom is no less than a wonder of the animal kingdom. It is produced by 
modified salivary glands, which, over the eons, have evolved to produce a cocktail of 
different chemicals, the effects of which depend on the snake species. The venom can 
be used to subdue prey or as a defensive weapon, and it is squeezed from the glands 
along the jaw and out through modified teeth called fangs. The fangs are hollow, and 
in some species, such as the vipers, they are so big that they have to be hinged. Some 
snakes produce venom that attacks the nervous system of prey, leading to rapid death, 
while others produce venom that degrades and kills whatever tissue it comes into con- 
tact with. These substances start digesting the prey from the inside out, even before 
the snake begins the elaborate process of swallowing its meal. 

♦ Snake venom is so diverse and so potent because snakes are sadly lacking when it 
comes to other weapons. They don’t have any limbs with sharp claws. The lack of 
limbs also makes snakes quite slow-moving animals, so their poisons have to be fast 
acting enough to kill prey before it has a chance to get a good distance from the reptile. 

♦ The king cobra is an active predator and will go out looking for its prey instead 
of using the ambush tactic. To help it locate its prey, the king cobra has very good 
eyesight and can spot its prey from distances of around 100 m. 

♦ Traditionally, the king cobra was revered in India and held in such high respect that 
villages were often vacated if a nesting female had taken up residence. Times change, 
however, and the king cobra is increasingly regarded as a menace, but it can still be 
encountered fairly commonly in this subcontinent.

MALLEEFOWL 

Scientific name: Leipoa ocellata 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Aves 
Order: Galliformes 
Family: Megapodiidae 

What does it look like? Adult malleefowl are large birds, about the same size as a domestic 
chicken. They are around 60 cm long and can be 2,5 kg in weight. The head is small with a 
small bill, and the plumage is in muted tones with white, black, and grey barring. 

Where does it live? The malleefowl is only found in Australia. Its range extends from south- 
western Australia to central New South Wales, In this range, it is restricted to semiarid 
scrub and woodland dominated by the mallee eucalyptus. 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 59 



Malleefowl — A section through a malleefowl nest mound also showing the male bird scraping away soil 
and leaf litter to regulate the mounds temperature. (Mike Shanahan) 


Build Your Own Incubator 

The malleefowl is a shy, retiring bird of the Australian outback. During winter in the South- 
ern Hemisphere, changing day length gets the malleefowl in the mood for courtship. Males 
survey their territory for a suitable site to build a nest. Unlike the rickety twig nest of many 
birds, the malleefowl’s nest is a real feat of avian engineering. In a suitable site where the soil 
is deep, the male scrapes at the ground with his beak and feet. These birds are not really built 
for digging, nonetheless they are tireless, and before long, they have excavated a substantial pit, 
which can be 3 m across and 1 m deep. When the pit is deep enough, the male begins the labo- 
rious task of dragging material into the pit. Depending on the location, this may be leaf litter, 
sand, or a mixture of the two. He drags and scrapes until he has formed a mound more than half 
a meter high. Winter in this location is the time for rain, and following a decent downpour, he 
will root among the nest mound to mix it. Turning the material over encourages decomposition, 
and he constructs a next chamber within the mound. His mate, which up until this point has 
been rather lazy, comes to inspect his work and deposits a clutch of eggs in the mound chamber. 
Over the next few days, the female lays eggs in more chambers eagerly prepared by the male until 
she has laid between 15 and 24, although a fecund female may produce 30. The eggs are large, 
and when she has finished laying, she may have produced more than 2,5 times her own body 
weight in eggs. 

With the eggs in place in the mound, the expectant parents have constructed themselves 
a large, organic incubator. The decaying plant matter in the mound and the heat of the sun 
warm the nest, nurturing the developing brood. The male is a devoted father, tending to the 
nest mound regularly, constantly making sure the temperature is correct for the eggs. If the nest 
gets too hot, he will open it up, and if it gets too cool, he will add more material. After the male 
has tended the giant compost heap for anywhere between 50 and 100 days, the young are ready 
to hatch. They break out of the thin-shelled eggs using their powerful legs, but they are also 


160 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


confronted with the difficult task of digging their way out of the nest. In 5-10 minute bursts, 
they scrabble frantically at the walls of their chamber, lying on their backs and kicking with their 
well-developed legs. Each of these digging bouts is separated by an hour’s rest. Depending on 
where they dig from, the journey to the surface of the mound may take anywhere between 2 and 
15 hours. Eventually, they emerge from their improvised incubator with beaks and eyes tightly 
closed. They take a look at their surroundings for first time and suck in a deep breath. Then, 
perhaps gathering their energy or listening for signs of predators, they stay completely motion- 
less for 20 minutes or so. 

By the time they have emerged, their parents have long since abandoned them to for- 
age amongst the scrub. They leave their hole and fall or stagger to the bottom of the mound. 
Completely independent, they scamper off into the scrub to begin their life outside the warm, 
cosseted confines of their compost heap. 

♦ The malleefowl is just one of a group of birds known as megapodes (Greek for 
“big feet”). There are 19 species of megapodes, or incubator birds as they are also 
known. 

♦ They are all found in the Australasian region, including Australia itself (three 
species), New Guinea, some of the islands in the western Pacific and Indonesia, and 
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. 

♦ The breeding season of these birds may extend for up to 11 months, and the males 
and females normally form long-lasting bonds. These established pairs occupy the 
same territory, centered around a mound, from one year to the next. 

♦ Only in his fourth year does a male malleefowl look for a suitable location to construct 
his own mound. The mounds of young males are nowhere near as impressive as those 
constructed by older, more experienced males. 

♦ Mallefowl can fly and will take to the trees if particularly alarmed, but they normally 
rely on their tremendous camouflage and ability to remain motionless for long peri- 
ods to keep out of danger. 

♦ Until Europeans colonized Australia, the malleefowl was a successful bird, stretching 
over huge swathes of Australia, Colonists, with their agriculture and menagerie 

of introduced animals, soon had an impact on these fascinating birds. Much of 
the malleefowl’s habitat was given over to the cultivation of crops or the rearing of 
livestock, and animals like foxes made short work of these birds, which are unwilling 
to use their power of flight. 

♦ Bones and old tales are the clues to two species of giant megapode that lived on cer- 
tain islands in the Pacific Ocean. Compared with today’s megapodes, these birds were 
very large and could have easily weighed 30 kg. A 2,5 kg malleefowl can construct 
quite an impressive mound, but the mounds produced by these birds must have been 
huge. Both species are sadly extinct, undoubtedly a result of human colonization of 
these islands. Exactly when they became extinct is a mystery. Some sources suggest 
populations could have survived until modern times, providing a conceivable inspira- 
tion for the almost mythical bird known as the du.

MARBLE GALL WASP

Marble Gall Wasp — A marble gall wasp

larva and pupa. (Mike Shanahan) 



Marble Gall Wasp — This picture shows a winged 
female that emerges from the spherical galls on oak 
trees. (Gyorgy Csoka) 


Scientific name: Andricus kollari 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Cynipidae 

What do they look like? There are several stages in the life of this insect, but the most obvious 
is the heavy-bodied female. She has a huge, globular abdomen, a humped thorax, and small 
head. The entire body is an attractive, chestnut brown color. 

Where do they live? The marble gall wasp is found throughout temperate Europe wherever its 
host, the oak tree, can be found; however, it is more common in less-disturbed habitats. 

Invasion of the Bud Snatchers 

Over millions of years, insects and flowering plants have a developed a very close relationship 
with one another. In many cases, it is the insects that live at the expense of the plants, nib- 
bling their leaves, chewing holes in their flowers and seeds, and generally making a nuisance of 
themselves. In the case of gall wasps, this relationship has grown to be one of the most intricate 
relationships in any terrestrial ecosystem. 



162 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


The complex story of the marble gall wasp begins with a pregnant female wasp using her 
sharp, little egg-laying syringe to introduce an egg into the rapidly growing tissue of a leaf bud. 
Due to reasons that are still poorly understood, the egg and perhaps the substances injected 
with it trigger frantic cell growth in the plant tissue, forming a gall. The effect is very similar 
to what happens when the cells of an animal go out of control to form a cancerous tumor. 
However, in the gall, the cell growth is controlled by something associated with the developing 
wasp. The gall expands, forming a spherical, woody structure. This little ball not only protects 
the growing wasp but also provides abundant, nutritious plant matter on which the larva feasts. 
Somehow, the growing wasps manipulate the cellular machinery of the plant to divert resources 
away from the where they are needed (i.e,, the leaves, stems, and reproductive structures) to its 
nursery sphere. 

If this weren’t complicated enough, the entire life cycle of the wasp is even more elaborate, 
involving a generation of males and females, and an asexual generation consisting entirely of 
female wasps. In the autumn, female wasps emerge that have no need of a male to breed. These 
parthenogenetic females seek out a suitably sheltered spot in which to see out the winter. With 
the arrival of the spring, the wasps leave their overwintering lairs and lay eggs into the developing 
leaf buds of oak trees. If the oak happens to be a common oak, new marble galls develop, like the 
ones described above. However, if the eggs are deposited into the developing leaves of a turkey 
oak, small galls form containing a sexual generation of males and females. 

♦ The gall wasps are diverse animals. There are 1,300 known species, and all of them 
make unique galls on a wide variety of plants. Other species undoubtedly await dis- 
covery, The galls of some species are tiny disks on the underside of leaves, whereas 
others are huge, spongy wasp mansions. 

♦ Gall wasps are not the only animals that are able to hijack the inner workings of a 
plant to meet their own ends. Mites can also form galls, as can nematodes. Galls can 
even be formed by bacteria and other microorganisms. 

♦ A gall gives the young insect a safe refuge during the most vulnerable stage of its life, 
but as with any protective measure in the living world, it is far from invulnerable. The 
evolutionary arms race existing between all predators and prey means that regardless 
of how an animal evolves to protect itself, it is only a matter of time before a preda- 
tor evolves new ways of bypassing its defenses. Several types of parasitic wasp exploit 
galls by using their long ovipositors to lay an egg on or in the occupant of the gall. 

♦ Apart from the various parasitoids that punish gall-forming insects, there are numerous 
animals that take advantage of the gall and the food and shelter it offers. These ani- 
mals are known as inquilines. Some live in comparative harmony with the gall former, 
while others are greedier and compete with the occupant for food, sometimes causing 
its death 

♦ In some species of gall wasp, the life cycle is far more complicated than that of the 
marble gall wasp. One such species is the small wasp that forms the large galls on oaks 
known as oak apples. Each oak apple contains only male or females. The females mate 
and descend to the ground to lay their eggs on the fine roots of the host tree. These eggs 
form small galls that give rise to an asexual generation of parthenogenetic females, 

♦ Gall-forming insects have been around for many millions of years, and they probably 
evolved from an ancestor that burrowed into the host plant, seeking food. 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 63 


♦ The science of studying galls is known as cecidology and involves understanding what 
animal forms a gall and exactly how the animal does so. The how is complicated, as 

a feeding insect inside one of these galls will produce a range of compounds, some 
of which are in its saliva, while other are in its feces, and still others exude from its 
cuticle. Exactly which of these is involved in manipulating the plant is difficult to 
study. There could be a huge number of interactions taking place, all of which play 
their own small part in the formation of a gall. 

♦ Although the late Alfred Kinsey is famous for his Kinsey Reports, he was first and 
foremost a zoologist who specialized in the study of gall wasps.

PLATYPUS 



Scientific name: Ornithorhynchus anatinus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Monotremata 
Family: Ornithorhynchidae 

What does it look like? The platypus is a bizarre-looking mammal with a ducklike bill, black, 
beady eyes, dense fur, large webbed feet with claws, and a flattened tail like that of a beaver. The 
males are far larger than females, ranging from 45 to 60 cm and tipping the scales at 1-2,4 kg 



164 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? The platypus is found only in Australia, and even there it is restricted to the 
eastern part of the country. It has a liking for freshwater and is found in rivers and streams. 

Egg Laying, but Not by a Bird 

The duck-billed platypus is right up there with the naked mole rat in the odd mammal stakes. It 
has the face of a duck, but has little in common with birds. Like other mammals it can regulate 
its own body temperature, it has fur and mammary glands, yet it lays eggs like a reptile. It is also 
one of the few venomous mammals. 

In the late-eighteenth century when the dried skin of this animal was first seen in England it caused 
uproar among the zoological fraternity. There were cries of “fake” and “sham” as many experts of the 
time claimed it to be nothing more than an ungodly creation of a mischievous taxidermist. Alas, it was 
not a taxidermists trick, cobbled together in a back street from the body parts of various animals. No, 
it was a living, breathing animal, completely unlike any other mammal known to science at the time. 
So then, just what is the platypus? Well, although it looks like a mishmash of different animals, 
the platypus is undoubtedly a mammal, but a very primitive one at that. Internally, the male platypus’s 
reproductive organs resemble other mammals, with a pair of testicles (which never descend from the 
body cavity). The female’s internal reproductive anatomy, however, is not the mammal norm. She 
has paired ovaries resembling those found in birds and reptiles. Only the left ovary is functional, 
the other is small, underdeveloped, and never produces eggs. After mating, the female platypus digs 
a burrow, which can be as much as 30 m long and is blocked with plugs along its length to protect 
against flooding. This tunnel is lined with wet vegetation dragged in by the female under her curved 
tail. The nest chamber is lined with fallen leaves and reeds, and it is here, 2-3 weeks after mating, 
that she lays two small eggs (occasionally a female lays one or three eggs). The eggs are small (about 
11 mm in diameter), round, and leathery like a reptile’s. The female incubates the eggs for around 10 
days until they hatch and the tiny, naked young crawl out and cling onto their mother. The female 
doesn’t have teats, so the youngsters lap the milk that soaks the fur and collects in grooves on the 
female’s abdomen near the openings to the mammary glands. Every time the female leaves the brood 
chamber, she walls up the entrance. The young leave the burrow after 3-4 months, but they con- 
tinue to take milk from their mother. Needless to say, the male plays no part in rearing the young. 

Another interesting feature of the platypus, which may be linked to breeding, is the male’s 
ability to produce and use venom. On each hind leg of the male, on the back of the ankle, there 
is a short, curved, hollow spur that sits in a fold of skin and can be erected at will. This spur is 
connected to a venom gland behind the knee of the animal. When manhandled or grabbed, the 
male platypus will forcefully jab this spur into the transgressor with immediate results. A platy- 
pus sting is said to cause agonizing pain in humans and will easily kill a dog or small domestic 
animal. In humans, the affected limb swells up rapidly and can hurt for days or even months. 
The venom produced by the platypus is unlike other venom. Its unique ingredients seem to be 
intended to cause intense pain and immobilization, but not death, in humans at least. Although 
the platypus can use its spur and venom to defend itself, it is probably primarily important in 
the disputes occurring between males in the breeding season when they are defending their ter- 
ritories, but it is not known if the venom is lethal to the platypus’ own kind. 

♦ The closest living relatives of the platypus are the echidnas, or spiny anteaters, of 
which there are two species. It is unclear how these animals are related to the placen- 
tal mammals and the marsupial mammals. The reproductive organs of these animals 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 65 


have a lot in common with the marsupials. The eggs of marsupials, like those of the 
platypus, are encased in shells for at least some of their gestation. 

♦ The body temperature of the platypus is around 6°C lower than that of other 
mammals (32°C instead of 38°C), 

♦ The bill of the platypus is actually a very sensitive organ used for locating the small, 
bottom-dwelling invertebrates on which it feeds. The bill is not like a bird’s beak, 
and the mouth of the platypus is actually beneath this fleshy protuberance. Nerves in 
the rubbery bill not only sense touch but also the electrical field of their prey. When 
searching for food in the gravelly bottom of a stream, the platypus will move its head 
from side to side, searching for the tell-tale signs of its prey. Scientists are still trying 
to understand exactly how the platypus’s electrosense works. 

♦ The teeth of the platypus drop out when they are very young, so they grind their food 
between horny plates at the back of their jaws. 

♦ The platypus used to be hunted for its very dense pelage, which was valued in the fur trade. 

♦ Mammals typically have two sex chromosomes: X and Y, Interestingly the platypus 
has 10, and some of these are similar to the sex chromosomes found in birds. 

♦ When they are slumbering, mammals and birds all experience varying durations of 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a phenomenon that in humans is associated with 
dreaming. It was thought that since the platypus is considered primitive, it would not 
have REM sleep, but it turns out that the platypus has eight hours of REM sleep a 
night, which is considerably more than other mammals and birds. Exactly why the 
platypus should have so much REM sleep is still unclear.

RED-AND-BLUE POISON-ARROW FROG 

Scientific name: Dendrobates pumilio 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Amphibia 
Order: Anura 
Family: Dendrobatidae 

What does it look like? This is a tiny, jewel-like frog measuring only 25 mm from the tip of its 
snout to its rear end. The body of this minute amphibian is a fabulous red, while its limbs 
and small marks on it back are a shimmering blue. The eyes are large and dark, and beneath 
the head there is an inflatable throat sac. 

Where does it live? This species of poison-arrow frog inhabits the perpetually wet rain forests 
of Costa Rica in Central America. It can be found on the forest floor and also up in the 
trees, where it breeds. 

Parenting in a Poisonous Amphibian 

A red-and-blue poison-arrow frog hops and scrambles along the rain forest floor, providing a 

lively splash of color in the brown carpet of decaying vegetation. It reaches the base of a tree and 

surmounts a small mound of moss. Here, it perches for a few moments and emits a shrill call

and-blue poison-arrow frog taking the tadpole on

by inflating its throat sac. Another flash of color in the undergrowth nearby reveals this frog’s 
amorous intentions. He is a male, and he has spotted a female that he is trying to impress with 
his calling. His voice will not be enough to impress the female, and he gives chase with the hope 
of catching her and engaging in some romantic wrestling. Impressed by the calling, chasing, and 
wrestling abilities of this suitor, she lays 2-16 eggs on the ground in a secluded spot. The male, 
taking his cue, fertilizes all the eggs with his sperm and moistens them with fluids from his skin. 
The frogs are model parents, and they guard their eggs religiously until they hatch. Soon, the 
waiting is over and young tadpoles break free from their eggs and instinctively wriggle upon to 
the back of their parents, who must now take them to water. The journey may take several hours, 
so the tadpoles are securely glued to the parents with sticky mucus that also keeps them moist. 
Ponds and streams in the rain forest are crawling with all sorts of animals that would make 
short work of a tiny tadpole; therefore, the devoted parents head for the tree tops. Small pads on 
their feet afford them an excellent grip, and before long, they are in amongst the branches. Trees 
are not the sort of places you would expect to find good amphibian breeding spots, but lo and 
behold, growing on the branches are epiphytic plants, like bromeliads (related to pineapples), 
which, at their center have a bowl that collects condensation and rainwater. The parents deposit 
up to three of their young in every suitable pool they find. In the pool, there will be various 
insect larvae and other invertebrates that the tadpoles will feed on. To supplement the diet of 
her young, the female frog will also deposit unfertilized eggs in the bromeliad bowls, which will 
be greedily eaten by the tadpoles. In this sheltered microhabitat, the young develop rapidly and 
eventually metamorphose into adult frogs. 

After the careful nurturing provided by their parents, the froglets must fend for themselves. 
They descend to the forest floor and selectively hunt ants and other small animals among the 
leaf litter. Trace quantities of toxins in the frog’s diet are assimilated by the frog into its own 
defensive systems. The chemicals are stored in skin glands, and should any animal eat or even 
lick one of these frogs, it will be dead in no time at all. The amazing colors of the frog are 
not to brighten up the drab forest floor, but are a warning for other animals to give it a wide 
berth.

♦ There are approximately 150 species of poison-arrow frog, but their small size and 
habitat means that new species are being found all the time. They are only found in 
South and Central America. The red-and-blue poison-arrow frog is one of the more 
northerly species, but poison-arrow frogs as a whole are found all the way down to 
southern Brazil. Of the 150 or so species in the family, only around half are brightly 
colored like the species mentioned here, 

♦ It is quite common for small amphibians in the forest to use bromeliads and other 
epiphytic plants as breeding pools. In a large patch of forest, there will be thousands 
of these pools, adding another level of complexity to the already bewildering array of 
microhabitats that can be found in pristine equatorial forests, 

♦ A large brood of red-and-blue poison-arrow frog tadpoles may require repeated trips 
to the forest floor by their parents to transport them to their nursery pools. 

♦ The poison-arrow frogs, although remarkable for the lengths they go to rear their 
young, are also amazing for the toxicity of the substances produced by their skin 
glands. The red-and-blue poison-arrow frog is one of the less toxic species, but its 
relative, Phyllobates terribilis, contains enough poison to kill 100 fully grown men. 

The sheer potency of this poison in such a tiny animal is astonishing, but in the 
lushness of the rain forests, where danger lurks everywhere, it makes sense to be well 
defended. 

♦ When these frogs are maintained in captivity and fed on small flies and crickets, they 
gradually lose their toxicity, suggesting that their poisonous secretions are derived 
from the foods they eat, such as ants and beetles. It is thought that the same toxic 
compounds in the insects are taken in the by the frog and concentrated in the skin 
glands. 

♦ Advertising the production of a toxin with bright colors is common in the animal 
world. Such colorful displays are known as aposematism. It makes no sense for a 
poisonous animal to be drab and instantly forgettable. Bright, bold colors ensure 
that a predator with no experience will remember an animal that makes it sick, thus 
ensuring it will give the same species a wide berth in future encounters, 

♦ American Indians use the toxins secreted by these frogs to coat the points of their 
blow darts. Some of the more virulent species are held down with a stick, and the 
toxin is simply wiped on to the dart. Other, less-dangerous species are not so lucky. 
They are caught, impaled on sticks, and gently toasted over a fire to yield their poison, 
which is then concentrated and smeared over the dart points. Today, these rapidly 
acting nerve toxins are used for hunting game in the forest, but they were probably 
once used in tribal warfare as well. 

♦ Although these frogs are very poisonous, there are some animals that appear to be 
immune to the toxins produced by these frogs, A snake, Leimadophis epinephelus, is a 
specialist predator of these frogs and is an example of the constant evolutionary arms 
race that takes places between all predators and prey.

SAND TIGER SHARK 



Sand Tiger Shark — Cutaway of the female sand tiger shark showing her wombs 
and the developing, cannibalistic young within. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Carcharias taurus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Chondrichthyes 
Order: Lamniformes 
Family: Odontaspididae 

What does it look like? The sand tiger shark can grow to lengths of 3.5 m, though there are 
records of specimens over 5 m in length, and reach weights of 160 kg.. Adults range in color 
from grayish brown to bronze with a whitish underside. Youngsters have small dark spots, 
which fade as they grow older. The head of the shark is flattened, and the wide mouth is 
adorned with many fearsome-looking teeth. The pectoral fins are fleshy and immobile, and 
the first dorsal fin is positioned a long way back on the body. The tail fin is asymmetrical, 
with an upper lobe that is far longer than the lower one. 



LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 1 69 


Where does it live? The sand tiger shark is found in all warm seas except the eastern Pacific. 

They can be found at a range of depths, down to a maximum of around 200 m. 

Cannibalism in the Womb 

Sharks are one of the most misunderstood groups of animals. Although human perceptions 
of these animals are slowly changing, long-standing beliefs have painted these animals in a bad 
light, making them out to be savage, unflinching killers of the deep. The facts are far removed 
from the fiction, as these ancient marine animals are perfectly attuned to their watery world with 
a host of adaptations that contribute to their success. These adaptations are perfectly exempli- 
fied by the huge variety of ways in which they nurture their young, and of these strategies, none 
is more remarkable than the gestation of the sand tiger shark. 

A female sand tiger shark will only give birth to two young every two years, which is relatively 
slow for an animal of this size. The sand tiger’s secret to success is quality not quantity, as the 
few young that the female gives birth to are very well developed and are capable of looking after 
themselves as soon as they are born. To understand how the female can produce such well- 
formed young, we must learn a little about the environment inside her, where the young undergo 
their early growth. Inside the female, there is a pair of separate, capacious tubes. Each of these is 
a uterus and is similar, in some ways, to the womb found in female mammals. Eggs produced by 
the female leave the ovaries and descend into these tubes where they divide and grow, eventually 
forming baby sharks. The baby sharks are nourished by the store of yolk in their flimsy-shelled 
egg, and the first embryo in each uterus to reach around 6 cm in length hatches from its egg and 
actively moves through the fluid contained in the so-called nurseries. This is normal enough, 
as many other animals, such as marsupials give birth to tiny, poorly-formed, but active babies. 
However, what the baby sharks do next sets them apart. The young swim around inside the 
female and start feeding on their developing brothers and sisters. Even at this very early stage, 
they have a well-developed set of teeth and can make short work of their soft siblings. This baby 
predator grows and eats until it is alone in the uterus, all of its brothers and sisters consumed. To 
provide further nourishment for her cannibalistic babies, the mother continues to produce eggs 
that descend into the uteruses to be gobbled up by the two remaining young. After two years, the 
young are fully developed, and the female gives birth to them in a lengthy labor, which is unsur- 
prising as each shark is around 1 m long at birth. With their predatory instincts well honed by 
their time in the womb, the young swim off, perfectly capable of fending for themselves and big 
enough to be vulnerable to only the largest predators, 

♦ There are more than 360 species of shark, with new species coming to light as the 
oceans are explored. Most sharks are active predators, but there are a few species 
that strain the water for plankton, such as the whale shark and basking shark. They 
are extremely ancient creatures with a heritage that goes back hundreds of millions 
of years. The fossil record shows that the ancestors of sharks patrolled the seas over 
400 million years ago. Their basic anatomy is thought to be quite primitive, but some 
of their bodily systems, particularly their senses, have evolved to levels that cannot 
really be matched by any other living vertebrate. 

♦ The senses of the shark are very refined, and they have a whole battery at their 
disposal to sense their environment. Their sense of smell, which is really their ability 
to detect chemicals in the water, is unparalleled. They can detect a specific chemical 
(i.e,, a blood protein) in the water even when it is as dilute as 1 part in 10 billion. 



170 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Around their head and along the sides of their body are the tubes and pores of the 
lateralis system. This sensory system detects minute changes in water pressure, pick- 
ing up the tiny vibrations made by the thrashings of a struggling fish. Also around 
the head are small pits that detect the electrical fields of other animals. This is very 
important for species that snuffle around in the sand and mud searching for prey. 

Even when the prey is buried, its faint electrical field can be detected by the shark. 
Finally, they also have very sensitive vision. A special layer of light-reflecting crystals 
at the back of the eye improves their vision in dimly lit waters. As sharks are so well 
adapted to their aquatic environment and can occur in high densities, they are very 
important in the maintenance of marine ecosystems the world over, 

♦ Their bodies are a model of hydrodynamic perfection allowing them to cruise 
through the water with a minimum of effort. To provide buoyancy, many shark spe- 
cies have a huge, oily liver. However, the sand tiger is the only species of shark that 
sucks air into its stomach to act as a buoyancy aid. 

♦ The manner in which young sand tiger sharks are nurtured inside their mother is 
one of many strategies. Many species lay large, leathery eggs. Washed ashore, these 
empty egg cases are commonly called mermaid’s purses. Tendrils on each corner of 
these eggs anchor them to seaweed and rocks. Many sharks give birth to live young, 
and inside their mother, they are nourished by yolk, eggs ovulated by the female, or a 
milklike substance secreted by the uterus wall. The young of others are hooked up to 
a structure very similar to the placenta of mammals. 

♦ The predatory nature of sand tiger embryos was discovered in the late 1940s by a 
marine biologist who was internally examining a landed female. The young shark 
mistook the researcher’s probing fingers for food and gave him a sharp nip. 

♦ Although sharks are feared by humans, they are the ones under threat. Every year, 
more than 100 million sharks are killed for sport, for food, and for the other products 
they yield, such as leather and oil. With their slow rate of reproduction, sharks cannot 
sustain this unchecked level of exploitation, and many species are already critically 
endangered. Without complete protection in the very near future, it is highly likely 
that several shark species could be lost forever.

Ship Timber Beetle — A ship timber beetle larva keeping its tunnel clean to provide good growing 
conditions for the fungi on which it feeds. (Mike Shanahan) 


What does it look like? This elongate, cylindrical beetle can be up to 2 cm long, although 
the males are far smaller. The females are orange to light red with a very long abdomen. 

The males are also thinner bodied than the females, with a darker front end and a pair of 
feathery palps on the underside of their head. 

Where does it live? This beetle is found in woodlands and areas where wood is cut and 

stored. The natural habitat is deciduous woodlands, particularly wood edges, clearings, and 
sheltered, open areas. It is found throughout Europe and into the Russian part of Asia. 

Fungi for the Future Generation 

Female ship timber beetles, after they have mated, have the difficult task of finding a suitable 
place to lay their eggs. They are quite selective in their choice of egg-laying site. They hardly ever 
use healthy trees, but look for those trees that are diseased or are already dead. They will also use 
timber that has been felled. The female deposits eggs in crevices and cracks in the wood using 
her telescopic egg-laying tube. As each egg is laid, the female coats it with spores from a little 
pouch near her ovipositor. Secreting the egg in a safe place and coating it with fungal spores is 
the extent of her maternal care, after which she takes to the air in a labored fashion to find more 
suitable nooks and crannies on other trees. After a few days, the egg hatches, and a small, whitish 
larva wriggles out into the world and loiters around its empty egg shell for a while to pick up 
some of the fungal spores that its mother left for it. After a while, it begins to tunnel into the 
wood using its powerful mandibles, carrying some of the fungal spores with it. Initially, the tun- 
nel is very narrow as the larva is small, but as it grows, the tunnel must also increase in width to 
accommodate the grub. The tunnel may run for over 30 cm, snaking into the wood, but it is not 
the wood the larva is eating. The tunnel is, in fact, a sheltered fungus farm. The fungal spores 
provisioned by the female and carried by the larva, infect the wood, until the tunnel is carpeted 
in a white layer of fungus. It is this fungus that the beetle larva eats. The larva takes excellent care 
of its fungus garden so that it will have enough food to complete its development, doing every- 
thing it can to keep the conditions just right for the fungi. The fungus requires oxygen to thrive, 
so the larva must rid the tunnel of any debris to maintain a good flow of air. The larva shuffles 
along the confines of its tunnel pushing any wood dust and waste to the outside, where it falls 



172 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


to the base of the tree. By the winter, the larva will not be fully grown, so it will have to retreat to 
the deepest reaches of its burrow and enter a resting state to survive the cold, harsh conditions. 
With the spring, the larva reawakens and continues to feed on whatever fungi survived the win- 
ter, Soon, it is ready to pupate, and it wriggles to the tunnel entrance and enlarges the width of 
its burrow to form a chamber for its imminent metamorphosis, 

♦ The ship timber beetles all depend on wood in which to breed. They are regarded as 
forestry pests because of the damage they do to timber, affecting high-quality wood 
that today is destined for construction but was once used for shipbuilding. In reality, 
their effects on commercial timber operations are minimal, as they tend to go for dis- 
eased or dead trees, 

♦ The fungi carried by the female and eaten by the larvae is a yeastlike fungus 

(. Endomyces hylecoeti) that has struck up a symbiotic relationship with the beetle. 

The fungus gets access to wood in the safety of tunnels, and in return, the larvae 
get something to eat, 

♦ As you can imagine, wood hardly makes for an appetizing diet. It is tough, and the 
nutrients are mostly bound up within the molecule known as cellulose. No animal 
can produce the enzyme, cellulase, to digest this material; yet many animals, especially 
insects, feed on wood. Just how do they do this? Most wood-munching insects 
depend on another organism to break down the cellulose for them. The ship timber 
beetle uses the services of a fungus, while other insects have gone one step further and 
actually harbor the wood-digesting organisms inside themselves. Wood-feeding ter- 
mites have cellulase-producing bacteria in their gut, which break down the cellulose, 
releasing the simple sugars that can be used by the insect. Other insects have not yet 
developed this sophisticated trick and instead must feed for a very long time on this 
poor diet to complete their development. 

♦ Fungi are very proficient at breaking down and digesting wood, and this is a massively 
important component of the energy recycling that takes place in most land-based 
ecosystems. The fungi are the recyclers, taking the energy locked up in the woody 
tissue and making it available to other organisms in the system, 

♦ The ship timber beetle makes its tunnels in many types of wood, but it will avoid 
pines, larches, and hornbeams. Birch is a favorite, and a large, diseased birch with the 
correct conditions (warm and no less than 30-40 percent moisture content) will be 
home to many larvae, which give their presence away by the sawdust that accumulates 
at the base of the tree after it has been ejected from their holes.

LIVING AT THE EXPENSE 
OF OTHERS: PARASITISM 


ALCON BLUE BUTTERFLY 



Alcon Blue Butterfly — A worker ant carrying the alcon blue butterfly caterpillar back to its nest. (Mike Shanahan) 



174 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Maculinea alcon 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Lepidoptera 
Family: Lycaenidae 

What does it look like? The blue butterflies are beautiful insects, and the alcon blue is no ex- 
ception. The upper surface of the wings is a shimmering, metallic blue framed with a darker 
border and a narrow fringe of silvery white scales. The underside of the wings is paler, some- 
times with a brownish hue and bears small dark spots rimmed with silver. The head has a 
large pair of dark compound eyes and thin antennae ending in small clubs. The sexes are 
similar, but the females are larger with fatter abdomens, and the upper surface of their wings 
may be adorned with small dark spots. 

Where does it live? The alcon blue is found in many European countries, and its range 

stretches into Asia. It prefers warm/ sheltered habitats such as flower meadows where it may 
find the flowers of the marsh gentian and certain species of red ant. 


The Crafty Caterpillar 

Ants, with their very ordered and productive societies, make nests that are coveted by many dif- 
ferent animals. These subterranean strongholds provide excellent protection and a bounteous 
supply of food for any animal that is brave or smart enough to inveigle its way inside. The alcon 
blue butterfly is one such interloper that has opted for intelligent gate crashing. In the European 
summer, around the end of July, female alcon blue butterflies have mated and flutter earnestly 
around their home meadows looking for the closed flowers of the marsh gentian. The females 
alight and deposit their white eggs on the flowers, A few days later, each tiny caterpillar hatches 
out of the bottom of its egg and munches a tunnel straight into the closed flower of the gentian. 
The small caterpillar remains within the safety of the flower for around two weeks, eating some of 
the flower tissue and developing seeds, but growing slowly. In the flower, the caterpillar sheds its 
skin three times, and after the third molt, it is ready to take its leave of this safe house. In the early 
morning or evening, it chews its way from the base of the flower and shuffles along the petals to 
the apex of the bloom. Apparently tired of its nursery, it lets go of its grip and falls to the ground 
on a silken thread and waits. This is the riskiest time of its short life. Predators abound amongst 
the short turf, and all would make short work of a tiny, plump caterpillar, but a small, foraging 
red ant smells the caterpillar and goes for a closer look. The ant, seemingly intrigued and mes- 
merized by the caterpillar, strokes it all over with its quivering antennae. Result! If it could, the 
caterpillar would breathe a huge sigh of relief as this is exactly what it was waiting for. To express 
its relief, the caterpillar produces a drop of sweet fluid from its rear end that the ant immediately 
starts suckling. This can go on for some time, until the caterpillar flattens the middle or rear of its 
body. This act is enough to completely fool the ant into mistaking the caterpillar for a grub from 
its own nest that has somehow gone walkabout. It tenderly picks the caterpillar up in its jaws 
and makes for the nest. The caterpillar is deposited in the nursery of the ants nest alongside the 
countless young of the colony. Here, it blends right in. It smells right, and smell is all important to 
ants. The ants feed the caterpillar by regurgitating nutritious fluid, and somehow these tiny trick- 
sters persuade the ants to give them preferential treatment so that they receive more attention 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 175 


and food than the ant grubs. To add insult to injury, the caterpillars also supplement their liquid 
diet by scoffing the odd ant grub or two. On such a nutritious diet, the caterpillar grows quickly, 
increasing its weight by about 100 times during its first month in the nest. The caterpillar, well 
looked after and safe in the ant’s nest, stays put for the summer, autumn, winter, and spring, and 
only when the following summer arrives does it begin the transformation that will turn it into 
a fine butterfly. When it emerges from its chrysalis as an adult butterfly deep underground, the 
tricks used to deceive the ants have long since worn out. It must make for the surface as quickly 
as possible to escape the wrath of the ants. Fortunately, it has one last trick to avoid being held 
to account. The angry ants try and bite the fleeing charlatan, but all they come away with is a 
mouthful of scales. The whole body of the newly emerged butterfly is densely covered in loose 
scales, and the ants cannot get a grip on it. Eventually, the butterfly manages to leave the nest 
and makes for a perch among the lofty vegetation of the meadow. Here, its wings will inflate and 
harden in the summer sun until it is ready to flutter off with an air of innocence, 

♦ There are several species of blue butterfly distributed throughout Europe and Asia. 

All depend to varying degrees on ants to provide food and shelter for their developing 
young. 

♦ Ant societies are founded on pheromones. Nest mates recognize one another by the 
way they smell. These distinctive odors have been hijacked by a multitude of different 
animals, mostly other insects. An ant will not challenge an invader if it smells like one 
of its sisters. An ant’s nest is not only a safe place, but it is stuffed full of resources. 
There are huge numbers of defenseless grubs and pupae and all sorts of nutritious 
goodies to be found in the nest refuse piles. Some types of insects, especially beetles 
have become so inextricably linked with ants and their nests that they are found 
nowhere else. Some have modified antennae or bulbous glands on their bodies that 
produce fluids the ants find alluring — very useful if an appeasement is needed should 
the host smell a rat.

ANT-DECAPITATING FLIES 

Scientific name: Apocephalus species 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Diptera 
Family: Phoridae 

What does it look like? Ant-decapitating flies are tiny, measuring between 1 and 5 mm in 
length. They are typically humpbacked and drab colored in black, browns, and yellows, with 
large, delicate wings, long legs, and bristly heads.

Where does it live? These flies are found in any habitat where there are ants. They are par- 
ticularly diverse in the tropics. In the United States, they can be found from Alaska to 
southern Texas, although the largest number of species is to be found in the southwestern 
states. 

Don’t Lose Your Head 

Ants in their structured communities are normally found in dense aggregations. For the most 
part, there is safety in numbers — their nests are heavily fortified, and there are the snapping jaws 
of countless colony members. All in all, ants do not appear to be the easiest pickings around. Be 
that as it may, many types of animal have become specialist predators of ants, and one of these 
is the ant-decapitating fly, an insect that terrorizes ants in a particularly gruesome way. It is in 
the tropics that the ant-decapitating flies are at their most devastatingly diverse, and it is the 
leaf-cutter ants — those tireless laborers of the verdant neotropical forests — that are singled out 
for special attention. Weaving their way along the forest floor to a suitable foraging spot, worker 
leaf-cutter ants are blissfully unaware of the danger hovering silently above their heads: a female 
ant-decapitating fly that is ready to lay eggs. Spying a suitable target, she makes a darting flight 
downward and lands delicately on the back of the ant, which is many times her size. She is very 
picky about the ant species she selects. Some ant-decapitating flies will only prey on one species 
of ant, whereas others may use a handful of species. The fly probes around the ant using her 
sharp egg-laying tube, and with the dexterity of a seamstress, she pierces the thin membrane 
joining the various plates of the ant’s exoskeleton. Depending on the fly species in question, the 
egg is laid in the head, thorax, or abdomen of the ant. With a single egg deposited, the females 
takes off to search for more potential hosts. In the meantime, a larva eventually hatches from the 
egg, and if deposited in the abdomen or thorax, it will wriggle and squirm its way up to the ant’s 
head. Once in the snug head capsule, the larva settles down to feed, gorging itself on the muscles 
and other tissues that pack out the head of the unfortunate host. In the heat and humidity of the 
tropics, the development of the larva is rapid, and soon enough, the head has been emptied of all 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 177 


edible matter. The head capsule drops off, and the fly larva completes the rest of its development 
in the safety of this small shell. In an animal like a mammal, where all the massively important 
bits of the central nervous system are seated in the brain, such a fate would undoubtedly end in 
death. However, the nervous system of an ant has several small brains along its length. These 
ganglia can control walking and other activities, and as long as the ant has sufficient food re- 
serves, it may soldier on for a while until it keels over. In other cases, the head capsule may 
remain attached to the ant, but it is completely empty save for a well-developed grub or pupa of 
the ant- decapitating fly. 


♦ The phorid flies, the family to which the ant decapitators belong, is a diverse and very 
successful group of insects. There are more than 3,000 identified species, but as they 
are so small and so numerous in the tropics, the true number of species must be far, 
far higher. These flies are commonly known as scuttle flies due to their propensity for 
running instead of flying. More than 100 species of ant decapitator are known so far, 
but new species are being discovered on a regular basis, 

♦ The egg-laying tube of the female ant- decapitating fly is very different from species to 
species. Some species have a fearsome-looking right-angled hook, whereas others have 
a stubby, piercing trident. 

♦ The full extent of the relationship between these flies and ants is only slowly being 
revealed. In ant species, like the leaf-cutters of Central and South America, work- 
ers take special precautions to avoid being parasitized. For example, during their 
foraging trips, worker leaf-cutter ants are vulnerable to attack from these flies, 
especially if the ants are carrying sizeable slabs of leaves in their jaws and are not 
able to fend off the flies. To counter this, a tiny worker often rides on a big worker’s 
cargo and doggedly defends its bigger sister from the attentions of these meddle- 
some flies, 

♦ The fire ant has become a real problem in the United States after its accidental intro- 
duction in the 1930s, Fortunately, help may be at hand in the form of ant decapita- 
tors, The fire ant was accidentally imported with cargo from Brazil through the port 
of Mobile in Alabama. In the United States, this ant has no parasitoids to keep its 
numbers in check; however, in South America, certain ant- decapitating flies prey spe- 
cifically on the ant. The appropriate flies have been introduced to the Southeast from 
their native home in South America, Some introductions have not been successful, 
but more time is needed to see if these fascinating little flies can stem the plague of 
the fire ants, 

♦ Other ant-decapitating flies in the neotropics have become specialist parasitoids of 
stingless bees. These bees may play host to more than one larva, and some individuals 
have been found to contain 12 developing fly larvae, 

♦ Although very small, phorid flies are strong fliers, able to cover distances of at least 
10 km in a 24-hour period.

BIRD FLUKE 



Bird Fluke — The sporocyst of the bird fluke 
bulging into the eye stalk of its snail intermedi- 
ate host. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Leucochloridium paradoxum 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Platyhelminthes 
Class: Trematoda 
Order: Strigeata 
Family: Leucochloridiidae 
What does it look like? The bird fluke is a small animal. Adults are only a few millimeters 
long, flattened, and spiny. On their lower surface, they have suckers. The preceding stages of 
the fluke are microscopic and take on a variety of forms, including elongate and transparent 
mobile forms to larger, saclike ones lacking any discernible features. 

Where does it live? This is an animal of the temperate woodlands of Europe and North Amer- 
ica, but as it is a parasite, its actual habitat is the interior of snails and birds. 

Subduing a Snail from the Inside 

This small, unassuming animal typifies the bewildering complexity of some parasite life cycles. 
To complete its life cycle, the worm depends on two very different animals: a definitive host, in 
which the parasite multiplies, and an intermediate host, which harbors the growing parasite. 
This is quite a common setup for a parasite, but it results in one huge complication. How does 
the young freeloader get from its intermediate host to the definitive host? The solution used by 
the fluke is also complex, and it deserves an award for its ingenuity 

The adult flukes live within the intestines of woodland birds, such as crows, jays, sparrows, 
and finches, gripping onto the intestinal wall with their powerful suckers and feeding on the tis- 
sue and mucus of the bird’s insides, perhaps even ingesting some of the intestinal contents. They 
are hermaphrodites and have the necessary apparatus to produce tiny, oval fertilized eggs. These 
eggs leave the bird’s body in its feces, hopefully finding their way to the moist woodland floor. 
This is the beginning of a daunting journey in which the baby parasites must eventually find 
their way back to the definitive bird host. 


Bird Fluke sporocyst — This picture shows the stage 
of the parasite that can be found in the host snail.

(Oldrich Nedved) 




LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 79 


With a lot of luck, the eggs are swallowed by an unknowing and unfortunate snail, while 
it is munching on vegetation that happens to have been soiled from above by an infected bird. 
The egg hatches into a clear, transparent larva, which creeps around the body of the snail before 
undergoing a transformation and taking on a saclike appearance. This sporocyst, as it is known, 
grows through the snail from the central body in the mollusk’s digestive gland and forms a brood 
sac in the head and muscular foot of the snail, extending into the hosts tentacles. It is in the central 
body that the parasite replicates itself, producing a multitude of embryos, which move to the 
brood sac via a connecting tube. The embryos mature into what represents the juvenile stage of 
the bird-inhabiting adult. The development of the fluke has almost gone full circle, but these 
juveniles must still get from the snail into a bird. The sporocysts in the eye stalks of the snail 
swell, change color, bearing bands of green or brown, and begin to pulsate rapidly, clearly vis- 
ible through the taut, thin skin of the snail. With its eye stalks flashing like beacons, the snail 
wanders aimlessly into the open, unusual behavior for a retiring snail, which is influenced by the 
parasite. The throbbing tentacles look for all intents and purposes like small caterpillars, and 
they soon attract the attention of a hungry bird. The bird hops up to the snail, yanks off one of the 
succulent caterpillars, and swallows it. In doing so, the bird has aided the young flukes in their 
quest to complete their life cycle. Soon after being swallowed, the flukes mature and take up 
residence, as adults, in the bird’s gut. 

♦ The group of trematodes to which the bird fluke belongs is a very successful group of 
wholly parasitic organisms. To date, more than 6,000 species have been identified, but 
as the majority of vertebrates appear to be infected by at least one species, there are 
probably many more yet to be identified. They range in size from 0,2 mm to over 7 cm, 
and because many can have drastic effects on the health of humans and livestock, they 
have been studied in great detail by scientists. The life cycles of some of these animals 
are so complex that many have taken centuries to unravel. Species such as the liver 
fluke were known about for centuries, but it took a very long time indeed to find out 
how the adults actually infected cows, sheep, and humans. 

♦ In most species, the intermediate host is a snail. Their affinity for these shelled mol- 
lusks is not fully understood. Perhaps it is because snails are common in the moist 
habitats where the eggs and immature stages of these parasites are normally depos- 
ited. Snails also fit the bill because they are eaten by many other animals. This does 
beg the question, however, of why the parasite bothers with a definitive host like a bird 
or a mammal at all. One possibility for this relationship is that vertebrates often range 
over great distances and can therefore spread the eggs of these parasites far and wide. 

♦ Insects and rodents vie for the title of champion reproducer, but flukes must surely be 
among the contenders, if not the undisputed kings. Typically their life cycle involves 
the following stages: egg — miracidium — sporocyst — redia — cercaria — metcercaria — 
adult. The sporocyst gives rise to many redia, and these, in turn, yield large numbers 
of cercaria. One egg infecting the intermediate host can therefore give rise to many 
thousands of infective cercaria, each of which can develop into an egg-laying adult. Of 
course, nature is not extravagant, and these flukes do not do this just because they can. 
Their reproductive abilities say an awful lot about how slim the chances are of a single 
egg reaching adulthood. They have to pull out all the stops and be able to produce huge 
numbers of progeny in the hope that one will reach the definitive host to reproduce. 



1 80 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The blood flukes cause a debilitating disease in humans called schistosomiasis 
(bilharzia). This is thought to infect over 200 million people worldwide, and the 
species responsible (mostly Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni, and S.japonicum ) 
are some of the only flukes in which there is a male and a female. Another species 
of importance to humans is the Chinese liver fluke, which infects at least 30 million 
people in East Asia.

COD WORM 



Cod Worm — A cod worm clinging to the gills of a cod, its head end growing into the circulatory 
system of the fish. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Lernaeocera branchialis 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Maxillopoda 
Order: Siphonostomatoida 
Family: Pennellidae 

What does it look like? As juveniles, cod worms are tiny, well-protected animals. Covering 
their back is a large tear-shaped shell, and from underneath this, several pairs of fringed 
swimming legs can be seen. During its juvenile stages, the animal is only a couple of milli- 
meters long. The adult animal is quite different, with a wormlike, S-shaped body. 

Where does it live? The cod worm is an exclusively marine animal that makes its home in the 
waters of the Atlantic, and more specifically in certain fishes that live in this ocean.

Go Straight for the Heart 

Cod and haddock have a very raw deal, not only are they pursued relentlessly by humans as 
food, but they also suffer from numerous, amazingly grotesque parasites. Perhaps the most 
interesting of these is the cod worm, an animal with a fascinating, albeit grisly way of life. 
These crustaceans start life as small, free-swimming larvae that paddle through the water with 
manic intensity. This first, short-lived stage goes through the first of several transformations 
and ends up as a slightly more elongate animal with a pair of grasping hooks on the front of 
its carapace. These appendages are use to good effect to gain a good purchase on the first of its 
hosts, the sluggish, rotund fish known as the lumpsucker. Using its clawed limbs, the cod worm 
grips onto the host’s flanks and plugs a thin filament into the flesh of the fish to extract blood. 
During its time on the lumpsucker, the young cod worm goes through several stages, patiently 
waiting for a member of the opposite sex to arrive. When a male and female do eventually 
find one another, they mate, and the female, with her eggs fertilized, goes through yet another 
transformation into a longer form. Her long abdomen contains her eggs, and with these rap- 
idly maturing, she takes her leave of the lumpfish and adopts a free-swimming existence once 
more — this time in search of her final host. She will seek out cod and their relatives, such as 
haddock. She uses a multitude of tiny sensory cells to sniff out one of these fish, tasting the water 
for the slightest hint of the host’s odor. When a cod or a haddock has been detected, the tiny 
parasitic crustacean makes straight for its gills, using its hooked appendages to grip the deli- 
cate tissue of these respiratory organs. Firmly fixed to her host, the female goes through one 
final transformation. She changes into a creature that has to be seen to be believed. She looks 
nothing like a crustacean or any other animal for that matter. Her plump, wormlike body is 
held in an S shape, and nestled against the rear of her body is a coiled mass of egg strings. It 
is difficult to compare the adult cod worm to anything. In some ways, she looks like an organ 
that has fallen out of the fish. The front part of her body penetrates the body of the fish and 
enters the rear bulb of the host’s heart. Firmly rooted in the host’s circulatory system, the front 
part of the female parasite grows like the branches of a small tree, reaching down into the main 
artery of the fish. All the food the parasite needs is absorbed directly from the fish’s blood, and 
there she can remain beneath the safety of the host’s gill covers, releasing a new generation of 
cod worms into the sea. 

♦ There are at least 1,000 species of parasitic copepod, of which the cod worm is but 
one. They infect most forms of marine animals, from small, burrowing worms to the 
largest whales. Their commitment to a parasitic way of life is almost unparalleled. As 
adults, many of the structures and organs necessary for a free-living way of life are 
completely redundant and have been lost. The cod worm is just one of a huge number 
of species in which the adults look like little more than an unusual adornment on the 
host’s body. 

♦ The fact that the larvae of these marine parasites find their hosts at all is mind- 
boggling, Imagine a tiny creature, scarcely bigger than the period at the end of this 
sentence. At the will of the ocean’s current, it must find its host, which is little more 
than a vanishingly small speck in the vastness of the ocean. It is staggering that any 
of these animals manage to find their hosts at all. 

♦ The adults of these parasites are so unusual that for centuries zoologists had no idea 
what they actually were. Some scientists believed they were a form of worm, whereas 



1 82 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


others thought they were related to the mollusks. It was only when the life cycle 
of these animals was observed did it become clear they were actually a type of 
crustacean. 

♦ As the cod worm is such an invasive parasite, it is not surprising that its host suffers con- 
siderable damage. Not only does the parasite cause a great deal of structural damage to 
the hosts circulatory system, but the very process of breaching the fish’s skin and muscle 
opens a path to bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The parasite also extracts a lot of nutrients 
from the fish’s blood. With this constant drain on its resources, an infected fish can lose 
almost a third of its weight, and the oil content of its liver can be reduced by half. The 
host’s blood also loses about half of its all-important oxygen-containing hemoglobin. 

♦ One of the most unusual copepod parasites lives in a cyst in the muscle or body cavity 
of certain fish. The female is hardly more than a reproductive bag, absorbing nutrients 
from the blood of the host. The male, in what must be one of the most uncomfort- 
able relationships, is squashed against the side of the cyst by the corpulent bulk of his 
much larger partner.

even been found as far north as Ontario, Canada. They are usually encountered in open 
habitats, such as grassland.

Betrayed by a Love Song 

To attract a mate, male animals go to great lengths. Many of them have very bold and bright 
colors to appeal to females, others have a range of ornaments to use in breeding disputes with 
rival males, and some build things to get a female’s attention. These visual signs of a male’s viril- 
ity are all well and good, but the downside is that they make him stand out like a beacon. No 
self-respecting predator or parasitoid could miss such a show. Because of the disadvantages of 
broadcasting their suitability as a mate visually, some male animals hide themselves away and use 
sound. One such animal is the field cricket. In the safety of a burrow, it sings out to the females 
in the vicinity. The night air can be full of these subterranean stridulations, and for the most part, 
the crickets that make them are quite safe; however, over millions of years, a species of fly has 
developed the ability to listen in on these songs to locate its host. 

Ears are very unusual in flies, as almost all of them rely heavily on their sense of sight and 
smell to locate their food and mates. Of course, they do have other senses, but hearing is very 
rarely one of them. On the bulbous thorax of the female cricket fly, there is a pair of very thin 
membranes, which function like the tight skin of a drum, similar to the eardrum found in the 
ears of mammals and other vertebrates. These fly ear drums are connected by a small bridge 
formed from the exoskeleton of the fly, and each is wired up to the insect’s central nervous sys- 
tem. Not only are these structures possibly the smallest ears in the animal kingdom, but they are 
also among the most sensitive. Depending on where the sound of the singing male cricket is em- 
anating from, the tiny ear drums will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference 
may be as little as 50 billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly 
on a singing male cricket. It doesn’t have to stop and cup its ears; it just homes in unerringly on 
the source of the noise. Even if the cricket stops singing, midhoming, the fly can approximate its 
position from the last sound it made. 

Once it has been discovered, the cricket is powerless to stop the fly from completing its task. 
She walks over her host, and deposits lots of wriggling maggots on its body. A lucky maggot will 
find a weak spot in the armor of the cricket and wheedle its way into the body cavity of the hap- 
less host. Once inside the host, it will grow rapidly, gorging itself on the cricket’s organs. After 
6 to 10 days, the maggot is ready to leave its host. In preparing to leave, it empties its gut of all 
of the waste material accumulated during its feast. If the cricket doesn’t die from it insides being 
flooded with effluent, its time is definitely up when the maggot breaks free from its body. Within 
a short time after leaving the host, the skin of the maggot hardens and takes on the dark brown 
hue of the puparium. In the confines of its barrel-shaped puparium, the larva’s tissues break 
down and rearrange themselves into the structures of the adult fly. After 10 to 12 days, an adult 
fly emerges, perhaps a female, her ears twitching to the sounds of singing crickets, 

♦ The cricket fly is a type of tachinid fly. This is a large family of flies, comprising 8,200 
identified species worldwide, but as with all obscure families of insects, there are 
many more species yet to be identified. In the United States alone, there are thought 
to be 1,300 species. All tachinids are parasitoids of other invertebrates, mostly insects. 
They commonly parasitize the larval stages of butterflies and moths, beetles, and their 
larvae. The larvae develop in the body of the host. Tachinid parasitism always results 
in the death of the host, and for this reason, some have been used as biological control 
agents for troublesome crop pests. 



1 84 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ There are other flies, unrelated to the cricket fly, which parasitize singing cicadas. 
Again, they have small, but very sensitive ears that allow them to pinpoint the loca- 
tion of their host. One species, Emblemasoma auditrix, locates a cicada and clambers 
onto its body, edging under its wing in reverse. It uses the tough tip of its ovipositor 
to make a small gash in the large, sound producing organ of the cicada. It lays an 
egg in this tear, and the larva goes on to develop inside the body cavity of the host. 

A parasitized cicada is unable to sing because of its damaged sound organs. The mute 
host will no longer attract the attention of the parasitic flies, and the developing larva 
will not have to compete with others for the succulent insides of its host. 

♦ It might be expected that crickets and cicadas would evolve the ability to stop singing 
when parasitic flies are in the vicinity, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. The benefit 
of singing and attracting a mate obviously outweighs the risk of being parasitized and 
meeting a nasty end.

GIANT ROUNDWORM 

Scientific name: Ascaris lumbicoides 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Nematodes 
Class: Secernentea 
Order Ascaridida 
Family: Ascarididae 

What does it look like? Large nematode females are between 20 and 49 cm long and 3-6 mm 
wide, whereas males are 15-31 cm long and 2-4 mm wide. At the front end, surrounding 
the mouth, are three lips. The back end of the male is hook shaped. 

Where does it live? They are found all over the world, wherever there are people. As adults, 
they live in the small intestine of humans. 

Wandering Worms 

This roundworm is one of the most prolific human parasites with a staggeringly complex life 
cycle that depends heavily on sheer numbers and coincidence. It is thought that at least 1 billion 
people around the world are infected with this worm, which spends its entire adult life in the 
human small intestine. Like many other nematodes, the giant roundworm is superbly adapted to 
a parasitic way of life. Their environment is the small intestine, and consequently they aren’t de- 
pendent on the array of sense organs that other, free-living animals need to locate food or detect 
danger. Since they live amongst the host’s digested food, evolution has eliminated the need for a 
complex gut, thus freeing up a lot of space inside the worm for prolific egg production. Much of 
the females body is devoted to the production of eggs, and she does so in astounding numbers. 
At any given time, the ovaries of this worm can contain up to 27 million eggs, with 200,000 being 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 85 



Giant Roundworm — A wandering giant roundworm emerges from the nose of a sick 
infant. (Mike Shanahan) 


laid every day. The eggs pass from the host’s body in the feces, and if they are fortunate, will be 
inadvertently swallowed with food or water. 

Once inside the host, the eggs make their way through the stomach, protected by their 
tough shell, and end up in the in the duodenum where they hatch into microscopic larvae. Not 
content with staying put just yet, the larvae burrow through the intestinal lining into the cir- 
culatory system where they are spirited away in the blood. Eventually, they reach the right side 
of the heart and move into the blood stream that will take them to the lungs. In the lungs, they 
break out of the capillaries and into the tiny air sacs, through which oxygen and carbon dioxide 
diffuse in and out of the blood. 

During this complex migration, many larvae get lost and end up in every organ of the body. 
The larvae that reach the lungs remain there for 10 days, shedding their skin twice and growing. 
This causes lung irritation, resulting in a characteristic cough, and some larvae may be coughed 
up and swallowed. Some of these larvae will not be prepared for the harsh conditions of the 
stomach, but those that are pass through the acidic environment of the stomach and make for 
the intestine, where they mature. 

It is unknown why the larvae embark on this migration only to end up where they began. 
However, the migration route is similar to other nematodes that infect their host by penetrating 



1 86 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the skin. These other nematodes must migrate to the lungs in order to ultimately reach the gut, 
so perhaps the behavior of the giant roundworm larvae is a vestige of some ancestral necessity. 

The worm’s normal activities in the human host go unnoticed; however, they sometimes 
occur in such large numbers that they can cause some bizarre conditions due to their wander- 
ings, The worms may head downstream and find themselves in the appendix, which can be 
damaged, or they carry on down and emerge from the person’s anus. The worms also wander 
upstream and may block the bile and pancreatic ducts with fatal consequences, or cause dam- 
age to the liver. Their wanderings may also take them to the stomach, an environment that is 
not to their liking, causing them to writhe and thrash, making the infected person feel nau- 
seous. Often, the person may vomit one of these huge worms. Not only would this be pretty 
shocking, but breaking the worm as it is being thrown up can trigger a fatal allergic reaction. 
These upward wanderings are made easier when the host is sleeping and the worms don’t have 
to tackle gravity. In the sleeping, horizontal host, the worm will reach the throat and may head 
for the lungs or will crawl even further up and in to the ear and nose, causing a lot of damage. 
Sometimes, a slumbering person infected with these worms may awake to find an adult giant 
roundworm popping out of their nose or mouth. 

♦ At least 16,000 species of nematode have been identified, but there are many more yet 
to be identified. It is difficult to estimate how many species there are, but it is not in the 
realm of fiction to suggest that there may be a million different species. Nematodes are 
found everywhere, from the deepest ocean trench to the highest mountain, and from 
the miniscule spaces between the cells of a plant leaf to the gut of a grasshopper. Every- 
where! Not only are they found in every conceivable habitat, but they are also found in 
profusion. In one rotting apple, there may be as many as 90,000 nematodes belonging 
to a number of species, and in 1 sq, m of mud from the seabed, there may be well over 
4 million nematodes. Since they are normally so small, they are often forgotten about, 
but they are instrumental in the functioning of entire ecosystems, 

♦ Although there are many free-living nematodes, they have turned parasitism into an 
art form. No animal or plant is safe from the depredations of parasitic nematodes. 
They display the whole range of parasitic interactions, from those species that are 
parasitic for only a small part of their life cycle to those species that have lived a para- 
sitic way of life for so long they require a number of hosts and complex transmission 
routes to complete their development. They are extraordinary! 

♦ The human giant roundworm is very closely related to the pig giant roundworm, but it 
is still unclear in which host this worm evolved. It is highly likely that the nematode was 
originally a parasite of pigs, which adapted to humans when pigs were first domesticated. 

♦ The eggs of the nematode have a very tough, sculpted shell that is resistant to low 
temperatures, dry conditions, and strong chemicals. This protective coat enables the 
young worms to survive in unsuitable conditions for 10 years or more, until they 
are swallowed by a human. As the eggs can survive for so long, it is very difficult to 
eradicate this parasite. Reinfection is common, especially among small children who 
are always putting objects in their mouth. In some areas, human feces are some- 
times used as a fertilizer (night soil), which can be a source of infection. Uncooked 
vegetables can be another source, as can cockroaches and the wind, both of which 
transport the eggs. The eggs of this worm have even been found on banknotes. 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 87 


♦ The wandering behavior of the worms is sometimes the result of a female unsuc- 
cessfully looking for a mate. The male nematode has a hooked tail, and the female 
must wriggle through this to bring their genitals into contact. Crawling through tight 
spaces possibly fulfills this instinct, 

♦ The female must produce such huge quantities of eggs because so many will never be 
swallowed and will perish. The production of huge numbers of eggs is very common 
among intestinal parasites. Their eggs are simply scattered, and more often than not, 
chance dictates whether they will find a host. 

♦ Occasionally, the worms in the intestine of an infected person will knot into a writh- 
ing mass, completely blocking the intestine with dire consequences. It is thought that 
certain drugs used to treat other intestinal parasites can aggravate the giant round- 
worm, causing them to bunch together, 

GORDIAN WORMS 



Gordian Worms — An adult Gordian worm emerges from the back end its host, an unfortunate earwig, 
(Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Nematomorphs 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Nematomorpha 
Class: Gordioida 

Order: Chordodea and Gordioidea 

Family: Chordodidae, Gordiidae and Gordioideaincertae 
What do they look like? The Gordian worms are long, threadlike worms that can reach 
lengths of more than 100 cm. Typically they are between 5 and 10 cm in length. Although 
long, they are very thin, with a diameter of around 1-2 mm. When alive, Gordian worms 
range from black to white with a shimmering iridescence. There are no distinct features on 



1 88 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the outer surface of the animal. The head end is usually a lighter color than the rest of the 
body. Adults are often found coiled in what looks like a loose knot. 

Where do they live? Gordian worms are found all over the world in aquatic habitats, includ- 
ing lakes, streams, rivers, ditches, and even in the large, open water tanks that farm animals 
drink from. A few species are terrestrial and can be found in moist soil. 

Overcoming a Dislike of Water 

As adults, Gordian worms are very short lived, only seen fleetingly in the summer months, pro- 
pelling themselves through freshwater by whiplike thrashings of their long, sinuous bodies. Their 
odd, seemingly spontaneous appearance has always intrigued people, who conjured up stories to 
explain what these animals were and where they came from. The adult, threadlike form is just 
one stage in the life of these interesting invertebrates. The life cycle begins with a male finding a 
female and entwining his body around hers before depositing sperm from his anus around the 
female’s genital opening. The sperm fertilize the eggs inside the body of the female, and soon 
she lays many thousands of eggs in gelatinous strings that she attaches to aquatic plants. The 
eggs develop over a period of 15 to 80 days, eventually hatching to release small, highly active 
larvae. These larvae are very different from the adults. They are short, chunky grublike animals 
with a distinct head end bearing hooks and a proboscis armed with spines that can be projected 
and withdrawn like a tongue. The mobile larva must seek out and enter a host, such as a beetle, 
a grasshopper, a millipede, or even a leech. Exactly how it does this is uncertain; the actual act 
has never been seen. It is possible that the larva could latch onto a potential host and find a suit- 
ably weak point in the host’s armor, puncturing it with its sharp proboscis. On the other hand, 
the larva could opt for a lazier strategy, forming a dormant cyst and waiting to be swallowed by 
a suitable, unlucky creature. Should the young worm find itself in the gut of a host, it tunnels 
its way out into the body cavity using its proboscis. Within the confines of the host, the worm 
metamorphoses into the nondescript adult form. As the worm’s mouthparts are rudimentary, 

it cannot ingest any food; instead it ab- 
sorbs all the nourishment it needs from the 
bodily fluids of its host. The worm grows 
steadily for several weeks or many months, 
shedding its skin several times, until it is a 
fully formed adult, which must leave the 
host that has inadvertently nurtured it. 
The adult worm is an aquatic animal, and 
to ensure that it can pass seamlessly from 
the sheltered environment of its host’s 
insides to the safety of freshwater, it uses 
mind control. Somehow the worm hijacks 
the host’s behavior and makes it head for 
water, even though it may be an animal 
that never normally has any need to visit 
bodies of open water. Sometimes, the over- 
powering mind-controlling abilities of the 
worm are so great that the host will make 
a headlong dive into an open tank of water 


^ Go Look! 

Gordian worms can be seen in bodies of freshwater, even 
those as small as water troughs. To the untrained eye, the 
worm does have more than a passing resemblance to an 
animated, knotted horses hair. Finding an adults means 
that there are probably other individuals in the vicinity 
that are still in their host. Look for insects such as grass- 
hoppers or beetles that appear to be paying more than 
a passing interest in the water. The insect, in a moment 
of worm-controlled madness, may leap with abandon 
into the water before the worm bursts out of its abdo- 
men. The worm may also break out before the host has 
reached water. Earwigs are commonly infected. These are 
naturally creatures of the night, so look for those wander- 
ing around aimlessly in broad daylight. They will search, 
sometimes fruitlessly, for water. The worm, writhing with 
despair in the host, may simply break free even though 
water may be nowhere nearby. 




LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 89 


or even a swimming pool. With its natural habitat tangibly close, the worm bursts out of the 
unfortunate host. This is by no means an easy or minor process for the host. The huge worm 
emerging from its rear end will be 10 times longer than itself, at the very least. After a long 
struggle, the worm frees itself from its so-called vehicle and swims off to search for a mate. The 
floundering host, reeling from the traumatic exit of its passenger, soon dies, 

♦ There are approximately 320 species of Gordian worm. The types mentioned here are 
all denizens of freshwater, but there are also marine species. As adults, they are free 
living, but all need a host in which to complete their development. The unlucky hosts 
of marine species are crabs and shrimps, 

♦ There is some interesting folklore surrounding these animals. In some places, they are 
known as horsehair worms in the belief that horse hairs falling into drinking troughs 
spontaneously give rise to them. As these worms have a liking for tying themselves in 
knots, they are called Gordian worms after Gordius, king of Phrygia, who apparently 
decreed that whoever could untie his intricate knot should rule his kingdom. Alexan- 
der the Great, ever the practical sort, cut the Gordian knot with his sword and added 
the king’s empire to his own. 

♦ Very rarely, Gordian worms infect humans where they are found in the gut or in the 
urethra. 

♦ Some species of Gordian worm will go through more than one host, and some may 
only burst out in the autumn, an unsuitable time for breeding. To wait out the harsh 
winter months, they will form cysts on waterside vegetation, which they leave in the 
spring. In these cases, complete development may take as long as 15 months.

given as the longest length), thin, and pale and look for all intents and purposes like a length 
of thin spaghetti. 

Where does it live? The Guinea worm is found in Africa, but its range is not as extensive as 
it once was, as it used to be endemic in the Middle East, India, and Pakistan, but has been 
eradicated from those countries. Its habitat in the larval stage is freshwater, while the habitat 
of the adults is the mammalian body, particularly humans. 

Getting Under the Skin 

The Guinea worm is probably one of the best documented parasites of humans, with tales of its 
behavior reaching as far back as the second century b.c, in accounts penned by ancient Greek 
chroniclers. People who have been afflicted with an infection of this worm would argue that it 
is a deeply offensive creature, and it is true to say that many international organizations have 
waged a long war to rid the earth of this worm. However, unsavory affects aside, the life cycle of 
this much maligned nematode is fascinating: an elaborate, but elegant route from a freshwater 
pool to the body cavity of a human. 

The story begins with a microscopic larva drifting in the plankton of a small lake. With luck, this 
young nematode will be gobbled up by a passing crustacean, hopefully one of the little, fast swim- 
ming copepod species that are fixtures of pond life everywhere. The crustacean is the nematodes 
intermediate host, and it spends up to two weeks in the little crustacean going through the first 
two stages of its development. Stacking the odds even higher, the developing Guinea worm must 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 191 


now somehow get from the copepod to an unsuspecting human. Again, it seems to depend on 
good fortune, swallowed unknowingly by a human in a mouthful of water, still inside its little 
crustacean vehicle. Even when the young worm finds itself inside the definitive host, the journey 
is far from over, and the most difficult obstacles are still to come. In the stomach of the unsus- 
pecting person, the copepod and the nematode part company. This is not through any choice 
of their own, but because the acids kill and digest the copepod, leaving the nematode to go it 
alone. Somehow, the young guinea worm is invulnerable to the potent chemical cocktail of the 
stomach, and it passes on through into the intestine where it burrows out into the body cavity. In 
the warm and moist safety of a large mammal, the worm quickly migrates to the body’s muscu- 
lature, where it can grow. If there is a worm of the opposite sex present, the worm can mate and 
start to produce eggs. All this lounging around absorbing nutrients cannot last forever, and after 
10-14 months the female must embark on the last leg of her journey. She goes wandering, and 
in 9 out 10 cases she ends up in or near the foot. In most cases, the female worm causes a large 
blister to develop on the skin, just above herself. Eventually, this blister ruptures exposing a loop 
of the female worm. The ulcer causes a very painful burning sensation, and to relieve this the 
unfortunate person often bathes their feet in a pond or open well. This is the moment the female 
has been waiting for, and with no further invitation, she bursts, releasing thousands upon thou- 
sands of tiny larvae that find their way into the water, helped by muscular contractions of the 
females uterus, which can force out more than half a million young in a single push. Over the next 
few days, the female is capable of releasing more larvae, until her whole body is used up. These 
larvae drift and wriggle off to find themselves a copepod, so continuing the cycle, 

♦ There are several species of nematode in the same family as the Guinea worm. All of 
them inhabit the tissues of vertebrates as adults, 

♦ The exit of the worm from the skin is not only painful, but also leaves the victim suscep- 
tible to bacterial infections, which can be life threatening in areas where hygiene is poor 
and antibiotics are in short supply. These lesions, particularly if a secondary infection 
sets in, may be painful enough to stop the person from using or even moving the af- 
fected limb, causing crippling and locked joints. Infections may also occur at times when 
work needs to be done, such as crop harvesting, severely affecting victims’ livelihoods. 

♦ Once a person is affected with Guinea worm, there is little that can be done. There are 
no known drugs that are effective against the infection. The traditional treatment is to 
wait until the female emerges from the blister and slowly wind her out on a small stick. 
Completely removing the very long female can take weeks or even months, and wind- 
ing must be conducted with extreme caution. Breaking the worm can release fluids into 
the body of the infected person causing anaphylactic shock or other serious reactions. 

♦ Several international organizations are waging an eradication campaign against the 
Guinea worm. Asia and the Middle East are now free of the disease, as are several Af- 
rican countries, including Kenya, Senegal, Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African 
Republic. In 1986, there were 3.5 million cases of Guinea worm infection worldwide, 
but in 2004, this had fallen to just over 16,000. 

♦ The symbol of the medical profession, the Rod of Asclepius, depicting a serpent coiled 
around a staff is thought to have been based on the guinea worm being wound around 
a stick. The fiery serpent on the end of Moses’s staff is also thought to be a representation 
of the Guinea worm, such was its importance to people of the ancient Middle East, 



192 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Preventing Guinea worm is straightforward. When in areas of Guinea worm infection, 
always filter dinking water, especially if it originates from an open source. Using the 
material of a shirt is more than adequate. This will strain out the tiny crustaceans that 
harbor the larval parasite. Taking water from a covered well or other enclosed source 
is another easy way to prevent infection.

HUMAN BOTFLY 



Human Botfly — A courier fly carries numerous eggs of the human botfly on its abdomen. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Dermatobia hominis 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Diptera 
Family: Oestridae 

What does it look like? The human botfly is a large fly that resembles a blue bottle. It is 
around 2 cm long with a metallic blue luster on its thorax and abdomen. From the side, 
it has a rather hunched appearance. The legs are reddish in color, as are the large eyes. 

The fly has no functional mouthparts. 

Where does it live? The botfly is a forest creature of Central and South America. Its range 
extends as far north as Mexico and as far south as northern Argentina. 

Parasitism by Courier 

The forests of Central and South America are home to a great raft of insects that are desperate 
for a piece of a large, warm-blooded creature. Mammals fit the bill handsomely, and they are 
plagued by these biting and egg-laying parasites. Perhaps the most devious of all is the human 
botfly. Although it is known as the human botfly, it will parasitize any largish, warm-blooded 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 93 


animals, including birds. Livestock are a particular favorite as they are large, docile, and partially 
unaware of the insects buzzing around them. The female botfly, heavily laden with eggs, must 
deposit her developing young on a suitable host, such as a grass-chewing cow or an unlucky 
tourist. To do this herself would be tantamount to suicide. She is a large insect, and she makes a 
terrible din when she is flying. She could easily get accidentally swatted by an ungulate’s swish- 
ing tail or purposefully squashed by an agitated tourist. She needs a courier to do her work for 
her, and so she goes off to find one, A suitable courier is a fly or a tick that also spends its live 
lapping at the secretions or sucking the blood of warm-blooded animals. With a suitable menial 
identified, she tackles it in midair, and both go cartwheeling into the undergrowth. The botfly 
is a powerful insect, and it holds the smaller fly down with its powerful legs before curling its 
abdomen around and depositing an egg on the rear end of the unknowing courier. The courier 
feels that it is a little bit heavier than normal and gives itself a good grooming to free whatever is 
sticking to its body. It can groom all it wants, but the egg is stuck fast, and no amount of tweak- 
ing and stroking will remove it. Apparently unperturbed by its tussle in the undergrowth, the fly 
takes to the air, but its bad luck isn’t over yet. 

Where there is one female botfly, there are bound to be others, all waiting for a suitable fly to 
carry their eggs to an unsuspecting host. Before the little carrier fly gets anywhere near a poten- 
tial host, it may be lugging 12 or more eggs from different females. When it alights on the host 
to lick its sweat, the heat rising from the relatively massive body triggers the eggs of the botfly to 
hatch. Dangling from their eggs, tantalizingly close to safety and food, the botfly maggots drop 
onto the host and endeavor to get under its skin as quickly as possible. Safely concealed beneath 
the host’s skin, the larvae start eating, head-down in its tissues, forming themselves a cavity that 
is enlarged as they grow. They breathe using small holes at the back end of their body, which face 
the entrance hole to the cavity. After several months of feeding, the larvae are fully grown and 
are visible as large, pimple-like lumps beneath the animal’s skin. When they have had their fill of 
the host, they wriggle out, drop to the ground, and pupate in the soil. 

♦ There are many species of flies that develop and feed in this way, although there are 
some very interesting deviations from the general theme. For example, the larvae of 
the sheep nostril fly develop in the nasal cavities of sheep and goats, rasping at the 
mucus membranes with their mouth hooks and ingesting the blood. Stranger still is 
the horse-stomach fly whose larvae live attached to the stomach lining of their equine 
hosts. They are mostly found in hot countries, although certain species are native to 
cooler, temperate countries, 

♦ Dermatobia hominis is unusual as it routinely develops under the skin of humans. 
Infections can often involve many larvae, and many areas of the body can be affected, 
including the groin, the legs, and the head. Travelers to Central and South America 
can sometimes return to their home countries unknowingly carrying a cargo of botfly 
maggots beneath their skin. At first the lesions above the larvae look like small pim- 
ples, but there are sudden shooting pains caused by the maggot’s feeding activity. To 
rid the unfortunate victim of the infection, the lesion can be smeared with petroleum 
jelly or animal fat, suffocating the larva. In this situation, there is a possibility the larva 
may die and rot in its feeding chamber, causing a serious infection. An alternative 
method involves the surgical removal of the maggot with forceps, taking care not rup- 
ture its body. 



194 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The human botfly has been shown to use over 40 species of fly and one species of tick 
as carriers for its eggs, 

♦ Botflys cause considerable damage to livestock in the tropics. They damage the meat, 
ruin the hide, and leave the host vulnerable to infection with their feeding activities; 
but this is because humans are encroaching on their habitat, and the fly is just doing 
what it does best. 

♦ The lesions caused by the botfly in cattle can become infected by a bacteria that leads 
to a serious disease, known as lechiguana, characterized by rapid growing, hard lumps 
beneath the skin of the animal. Antibiotics are the animal’s only hope, and without 
them it will die within 3-11 months.

LEAF WASPS 

Scientific name: Trigonalids 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Trigonalidae 

What do they look like? By parasitic wasp standards, most trigonalids are quite large 

(5-15 mm long), although some species are as small as 3 mm. Body shape varies consider- 
ably. Some are long and thin, resembling the ichneumonid wasps, while others are heavier 
bodied. All have a characteristic hole-punch ovipositor. 

Where do they live? The trigonalids are found in a wide variety of habitats all over the world, 
apart from the high polar regions. They appear to be most abundant in the tropics, and only 
one species is found in Europe. 

The Certainty of Chance 

Reproduction in all animals is a haphazard affair involving a considerable amount of luck to en- 
sure the continuation of the species. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the trigonalid wasps. 
The gauntlet they must negotiate from egg to adulthood is bewilderingly complex and relies 
heavily on chance, Trigonalids are parasitoids, and like the rest of their kind, they feed on other 
animals as larvae. In most cases, a female parasitic wasp deposits her eggs on or in the host, but 
the female trigonalid does neither — she deposits her eggs on the leaves of trees. Using her short 
ovipositor, she makes a small incision in the outer surface of the leaf to form a small pocket. Into 
this pocket, she deposits an egg. She repeats this procedure over and over again, scattering her 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 1 95 



Leaf Wasps — A hungry caterpillar edges closer to the eggs of a leaf wasp. (Mike Shanahan) 


eggs over a considerable area of foliage. The plants she lays her eggs on aren’t just a random 
assortment of species, but the preferred food plant of the trigonalid’s primary host. The primary 
host is an insect that is often the sucker for the cruel intentions of parasitic wasps everywhere, 
the humble caterpillar, although the caterpillar-like larvae of sawfly are also targeted. The larvae, 
with their ceaselessly munching jaws, chomp their way through a large number of leaves. Em- 
bedded beneath the outer surface of some of these leaves may be the developing egg of a trigo- 
nalid. The eggs are small and tough, and in the blink of an eye, they have been swallowed by the 
ravenous caterpillar. With the odds stacked against them, the unhatched trigonalid larvae have 
succeeded in the first part of their difficult mission. 

Once inside the gut of the caterpillar, the enzymes and other gastric secretions act as a cue 
for the larva to hatch from its tough capsule. This process may even be triggered as soon as the 
egg is taken into the mouth of the host, where it is bathed in saliva and chewed. Experiments 
have shown that eggs that are chewed on are much more likely to hatch. Whatever the trigger, 
the larva wriggles from its egg and makes for the gut wall of its host. The environment in the gut 
is harsh and alkaline, and few things can survive there. Using means not completely understood, 
but perhaps a combination of erosive secretions and mechanical rasping, the larva burrows 
through the gut wall and into the body cavity of the caterpillar. This space is filled with hemo- 
lymph, the insect equivalent of blood, and through this medium it swims with grim intent, ap- 
parently searching for something. What the small trigonalid larva is looking for is the maggot of 
a parasitic fly or wasp, which has been growing in the caterpillar, feeding in safety on the nones- 
sential tissues of the caterpillar and absorbing nutrients from the blood. Only a small percentage 
of caterpillars will be infected with the right parasite; therefore, it is not only a massive long-shot 
for the trigonalid larva to get into a caterpillar but also to be swallowed by one containing the 



196 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


right parasitoid. In this unusual, diminutive aquatic habitat, the original parasitoid larva is soon 
to get a taste of its own medicine. It can’t leave the host until it is fully developed; therefore, it is 
a sitting duck, waiting for the trigonalid larva to sniff it out. This is one elaborate way in which 
the trigonalids complete their development. The survival of other trigonalid species also hinges 
on coincidence, but the supporting cast is slightly different. They still depend on a caterpillar or 
sawfly larvae, but this time, the caterpillar must be captured by a social vespid wasp, butchered, 
and fed to one of its grubs back at the nest. In the flesh of the dead caterpillar are the eggs of the 
trigonalid, and once swallowed by the wasp grub, they can complete their development. 

♦ The trigonalids are a small group of parasitic wasps. Around 90 species are known, 
but they are rare animals, and it is very likely many more species are yet to identified, 
especially in the tropics, 

♦ As trigonalids have such an unusual, scatter-gun approach to host infection, many 
eggs are needed. A single female trigonalid can produce as many as 10,000 eggs in her 
short lifetime, 

♦ Although many trigonalids are what is known as hyperparasites, requiring a parasite 
already within a host, some species parasitize the caterpillar or sawfly larva directly. 

♦ The distribution of some of the trigonalids suggests that within the parasitic wasps 
they are an ancient group. They have probably been living out their extraordinary lives 
for many millions of years. The oldest trigonalid known was found entombed in a 
lump of amber from the mid-Cretaceous, making it around 100 million years old. 

♦ The best way to catch an adult trigonalid is to use a malaise trap, which looks like a 
tent made from very fine gauze. Insects like wasps and flies will be intercepted by the 
upright wall of the trap and walk up to its apex, where they will enter a collecting ves- 
sel filled with preserving fluid. Such a trap can be left in place for a number of days or 
even weeks.

on other rabbit species, hares, and occasionally dogs and cats. Like all fleas, they are proficient 
parasites with a number of adaptations allowing them to find and stick to a host. Their power- 
ful back legs enable them to jump huge distances for such a small animal. Their flattened bodies 
allow them to lie close to their hosts skin, making them difficult to dislodge, and their sharp 
mouthparts can pierce the tough skin of their host to suck the blood flowing beneath. The rab- 
bit flea has a further adaptation, refining its parasitic ways still further. Its relationship with the 
rabbit is a long one, and during this time, it has tuned in to its hosts cycles and rhythms to the 
extent that its own reproduction is dictated by the hormones of the rabbit. 

The rabbit flea does not move around much and spends most of its time attached to the ears 
of its host, keeping its head down and sucking blood. However, 10 days before the female host 
gives birth, the female fleas change. They start to reach sexual maturity. Their ovaries develop 
and start producing eggs of their own. It doesn’t need a calendar to know when the time is right; 
instead it tastes the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone, hormones in the rabbit’s blood, 
indicating that the arrival of the host’s young is imminent. The fleas sit out these 10 days with 
their mouthparts plugged into the bunny tasting the changing chemistry of its blood. As soon 
as the babies are born, they must extract their sucking stylets, leave the lofty perch of the ears, 
and make for the face of the rabbit, accompanied by the male fleas. Once at the face, the insects 
can easily hop onto the newborn baby rabbits as they are nuzzled by their flea-bitten mother. 
On these new, smaller hosts, the fleas feed voraciously, mate, and lay their eggs — all triggered by 
increasing levels of growth hormones in the blood of the baby rabbits. After 12 days of feeding, 
mating, and egg laying, the fleas leave the virgin territory of the newborn rabbits and return to 
the mother rabbit. As a female rabbit can give birth to a litter of young every 31 days on average,

EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


the fleas make this miniature migration on a regular basis, successfully parasitizing each new 
generation of rabbits, 

♦ There are around 2,500 species of fleas, and every single one of them parasitizes mam- 
mals or birds. Unlike many of the insect parasites of vertebrates, the fleas have a larval 
stage that can only develop in a sheltered environment. This limits them to hosts 
with nests or regularly used burrows, A perfect example of this is the human flea. The 
homes of people make an ideal breeding ground for flea larvae. No other primates have 
fixed dwellings; therefore, fleas can never make a living on monkeys or apes, 

♦ The larvae of fleas are maggoty creatures that wriggle around in the nests of their 
host, feeding on detritus and the digested blood defecated by the adult fleas on the 
nest owner, 

♦ All fleas are wingless. Wings would be a burden for a parasite of birds and mammals 
as scrabbling through fur and feathers would quickly damage them. Normally, fleas 
crawl clumsily around their host, using their piercing mouthparts as anchors, but 
when they first hatch from their pupae, or if they are dislodged, they use their back 
legs to make huge leaps. Their prodigious jumping abilities are not due to massive 
muscles, but the elastic properties of a protein called resilin. This material is found in 
the wings and thorax of many insects, and its elastic abilities make a bouncy rubber 
ball look a bit flat. These stretchy qualities are used to their maximum in the fleas. 
Preparing for a leap, the flea notches back its hind legs to a catching point, compress- 
ing the resilin like a tiny, but powerful spring. Poised, the flea releases the catch and 
is catapulted into the air. In human terms, this is equivalent to a person jumping to a 
height of over 200 m and covering a distance of 140 m. Measure for measure this is 
the greatest jump of any animal. 

♦ During these jumps, a flea reaches an acceleration of 140G in a little more than a 
millisecond, a force that would tear a larger animal to pieces. Muscles would never be 
able to simulate this feat as they contract too slowly and don’t perform very well in 
low temperatures, 

♦ Although fleas are very interesting animals, their reputation is tarnished because of 
the numerous diseases they transmit. Plague, probably the single most important 
disease in human history, is transmitted by the oriental rat flea. The pandemic of 
plague in the fourteenth century killed more than a quarter of all Europeans (25 mil- 
lion people). The bacteria that causes plague is found in rodents and is sucked up by 
the fleas when they are feeding on blood. Inside the flea, the bacteria reproduce to the 
extent that they can block the insects throat, and when the flea bites a human, which 
it inevitably will, the bacteria are regurgitated into the wound, eventually causing the 
nasty symptoms of plague. This disease goes through cycles of epidemic and remis- 
sion, and at the moment, it appears to be in remission. However, a huge reservoir of 
bacteria can be found in rodents, dogs, and fleas, and it is only a matter of time until 
there is another large outbreak. 

♦ Myxomatosis is an infamous virus transmitted by the rabbit flea, amongst other biting 
insects. It originated in South America, where rabbits are quite resistant to it and was in- 
troduced intentionally into Australia to control the burgeoning rabbit population. In the 
1950s and 1960s, huge numbers of rabbits were killed across Europe and in Australia.

RED-TAILED WASP 



Red-Tailed Wasp — A red-tailed wasp injects its 
eggs and viral particles into the body of a caterpillar. 
(Mike Shanahan) 



Red-Tailed Wasp — A female red-tailed wasp inject- 
ing an egg in her host, a tobacco bud worm caterpil- 
lar. (Andrei Sourakov and Cosuelo De Moraes) 


Scientific name: Cardiochiles nigriceps 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Braconidae 

What does it look like? This braconid is a small wasp, about 9 mm long. Its wings and the 
front part of its body are black, while its abdomen and its hind legs are red. The first few 
segments of the abdomen are rather narrow, giving it a slim waist. The antennae are long 
and black and are formed from many minute segments. 

Where does it live? This wasp is native to the eastern and southwestern United States, but it 
can also be found in California. It is found in association with tobacco plants, on which it 
finds its host. It has been purposefully introduced to other parts of the world where tobacco 
is grown commercially. 

Biological Weapons 

Today, tobacco is grown all over the world to provide millions of people with the nicotine fix they 
require every day. Although this crop is valuable to humans, many other animals like to nibble 
it. One of these is the tobacco budworm, a dingy little caterpillar that likes nothing more than 
the succulent parts of this valuable plant. These budworms do untold damage as hungry hordes 
of them chew their way into the flower buds and blossoms of the tobacco plant. Fortunately for 
smokers everywhere, these voracious little caterpillars do not have free reign of the tobacco har- 
vest, Flying delicately through the foliage of the crop, small, glossy female red-tailed wasps search 



200 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


for the tell-tale signs of the caterpillar’s feeding activity. The wasp tastes the air for the distinctive 
scent given off by the tobacco plant when it is being eaten and perhaps even the odorous scent 
of the caterpillars waste products. However they find their prey they are very good at it, and as 
soon as they are in the vicinity of a caterpillar, they alight and do the last stage of the hunt on 
foot. Normally the caterpillar is oblivious to most things apart from eating, but it will detect the 
presence of the wasp and may convulse wildly in attempt to scare the parasite away. Carefully, 
so as not to alarm the caterpillar, the wasp rears up and twists its abdomen through its legs. The 
wasp’s syringe-like ovipositor is inched toward the host and is delicately used to puncture the 
skin of the plump caterpillar. All of this happens in the blink of an eye, and before the caterpillar 
knows what has happened, it is playing host to the tiny egg of the female wasp. In itself this is 
not that special. Thousands of smallish wasps parasitize their hosts in the same way, but what 
sets this animal and its relatives apart from the majority of other parasitic wasps is the other 
things it injects into the host along with the egg. 

Surrounding the egg like microscopic bodyguards are tiny particles that bear more than a 
passing resemblance to viruses. These viruses appear to be unique to these wasps and are created 
in an organ inside the female called the calyx. The DNA of the wasp actually contains portions 
that are the templates for the components of the viral particles. The role of these viral parti- 
cles gives a whole new meaning to the term biological warfare. Somehow, they trick the immune 
system of the host, and the wasp’s egg develops unmolested. They cloak the egg, making it appear 
to the host’s immune cells as part of caterpillar’s body and therefore safe. Completely free from 
the attentions of the host’s last line of defense, the egg hatches and the larva feeds on the soft, 
juicy insides of the caterpillar. The host continues as normal, but when it has shed its skin for the 
fourth or fifth time, it pupates prematurely and dies, a result of the growing larva controlling its 
development and feeding on its essential organs. 

♦ Braconids and their close relatives, the ichneumonids, are among the most numerous 
types of insect in terms of species. Over 12,000 species of braconid have been identi- 
fied so far, but it is very likely that more than four times this number exist, 

♦ Their great diversity is a reflection of the variety of insect life as the hosts of many 
of these wasps are the larvae of beetles, flies, butterflies and moths, and the various 
stages of true bugs, such as aphids. Many braconids parasitize only one host, although 
others parasitize a range of species. Fossils suggest that these wasps first appeared in 
the Creataceous period, more than 65 million years ago. This was when the flowering 
plants first appeared. The appearance of many new types of food led to the evolution 
of new species of plant-feeding insects, which in turn provided food for an increasing 
diversity of predators and parasitoids. 

♦ Any familiar insect you see will be the host of at least one species of parasitic wasp. 
For every butterfly you see, many others will have perished as caterpillars and pupae 
at the hands of these amazing little parasitoids. 

♦ The red-tailed wasp and its predilection for the tobacco bud worm is an example of 
how farmers can protect their crops without having to rely on toxic insecticides. All 
the animals in an ecosystem live in balance with one another. The parasitoids cannot 
kill all of their hosts as it would lead to their own extinction. In a situation free from 
human intervention, the parasitoids regulate the populations of their hosts. However, 
when farmers spray their crops with poisonous chemicals, they not only kill the pests, 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 201 


but also the predators and parasitoids of these pests. The latter often struggle to re- 
cover from these dousings, while the pests bounce back rapidly. As they are no longer 
being eaten and parasitized, these pest populations reach plague proportions. This is 
the inevitable long-term result of intensive agriculture. Harnessing the populations 
of natural predators and parasitoids allows farmers to protect their crops from pests 
without resorting to pesticides.

SABRE WASP 



Sabre Wasp — Using her ovipositor a female sabre wasp drills through wood to the host larva on 
which her young will develop. (Mike Shanahan) 



202 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Rbyssa persuasoria 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Ichneumonidae 

What does it look like? This is one of the largest ichneumon wasps. The body of the insect 
can be around 4 cm long, with another 4 cm in the form a long, thin egg-laying tube 
(ovipositor). This splendid insect is glossy black with white/yellow markings. The legs 
are normally of an orange hue, A long pair of constantly flickering antennae issue from 
the head of the wasp. 

Where does it live? The sabre wasp is a denizen of conifer forests in the Northern Hemi- 
sphere all the way down to the latitudes of North Africa. Within these forests, open 
patches such as clearings and paths are preferred because of the sheltered, warm condi- 
tions they offer. 

Out of Sight, but Not Out of Mind 

During the summer months in conifer forests, the parasitic sabre wasp can often be seen flying 
purposefully through clearings and along sunlit paths. As it flies, it senses the air for tell-tale 
signs of its host. Exactly what it smells is unclear, but it is thought to be the feces and feeding 
debris of large, wood-boring wasp larvae that live in tunnels deep in the conifer wood. As soon 
as the wasp detects the distinctive odor, it follows the source to a large, fallen conifer. Alighting 
on the trunk of the tree, it moves jerkily back and forth, its antennae constantly twitching. It 
senses that somewhere beneath its feet is a wasp larva greedily munching a tunnel through the 
wood, but it is impossible to tell the exact position of its prey from smell alone. By flicking its 
antennae on the wood, the wasp listens for minute differences in sound that may pinpoint the 
position of the host. It is also possible that the wasp can actually hear the host larva rasping 
at the wood with its powerful mandibles several centimeters below the bark. Confident it has 
identified the correct location, the wasp begins to drill. It doesn’t do this by chewing the wood 
or frantically scrabbling with its feet, but by arching its abdomen high into the air and levering 
the long needle-like ovipositor until the tip of it engages the wood. The ovipositor is composed 
of two parts that can slide past one another, enabling the tip to be forced through the wood, like 
some sort of mechanical drill. The tip of the ovipositor steadily edges through the wood, and 
after approximately 30 minutes, it may have breached the tunnel wall of the host larva, which is 
blissfully unaware of the piercing egg layer that is heading straight for it. The very flexible ovi- 
positor delivers a paralyzing sting to the host larva and then deposits an egg in the tunnel near 
the doomed grub. After a few days, the parasite egg hatches, and there in front of it is the only 
food it will ever need as a juvenile. It makes straight for the paralyzed grub and starts tucking 
in straight away, being careful not to nibble or chomp any crucial bits that could kill the host. 
The parasite wants the host to remain alive for as long as possible so the flesh doesn’t spoil, but 
when it is nearly fully grown, it will deliver the coup de grace and kill the hapless host. Safe in 
the tunnel, the sabre wasp larva pupates in a cocoon that it spins from silk extruded by glands in 
its mouth. In the cocoon, the tissues of the larvae are reordered into the adult form, and it may 
remain in this state in the tunnel for the winter, emerging as an adult the following summer. 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 203 


♦ The ichneumonids and their 
close relatives, the braconids, are 
thought to be represented by 
80,000 species, at the very least, 
all of which are parasitic. Many 
species of ichneumon will tuck 
their egg inside the host using 
the pointed ovipositor; however, 
some species, like the sabre wasp, 
go after larvae concealed in vari- 
ous plants. In these tunnels, the 
eggs can be deposited on or near 
the host, 

♦ For a long time, scientists have 
cogitated on how the sabre wasp 
drills through wood with an 
ovipositor composed of chitin. 

Surely, over time the drilling pro- 
cess would wear the ovipositor 
down to a nub. It was discovered 
recently that the cuticle of the 
wasp, especially in crucial places 
like the ovipositor and mandi- 
bles, is impregnated with metals, 
including zinc and manganese. 

These elements afford the ovi- 
positor added strength for pen- 
etrating the wood. Not only do 
these metals assist in the drilling 
process, but they also come in useful when the adult insect has hatched from its pupa 
and needs to chew its way out of the tree, 

♦ In North America, there is a species of ichneumon very similar to the sabre wasp, 
but it is much larger. It is known as Megarhyssa and is brown with yellow and black 
markings. 

♦ When the wasp is laying an egg onto its host, the egg has to be forced through the 
very narrow tube of the ovipositor; therefore, it is deformed into a sausage shape and 
pushed through the narrow channel. 

♦ Sabre wasps and their hosts, the large wood wasps, are often found inside newly built 
homes. They don’t fly in through windows, but emerge from the timbers used in the 
construction of the house.

^ Go Look! 

Ichneumon wasps and their close relatives, the braconids, 
can be commonly encountered in the summer months. 
They are predominantly black with bold markings and 
constantly twitching antenna often bearing white flashes. 
They are typically to be seen feeding on nectar from flow- 
ers or scudding low amongst the vegetation. The nectar 
and pollen they collect from flowers fuels their flight, and 
both male and females will visit floral blooms. When you 
observe one of these wasps flying with intent low among 
the herbage, you are witnessing a female looking for a 
host in which her offspring can develop. Caterpillars are 
often the targets of these searches. It is rare to catch an 
ichneumon in the act of slipping its egg into the plump 
body of a living caterpillar as the whole act is over very 
quickly, with the host barely looking up from the leaf it 
is earnestly munching. An excellent way to watch the de- 
velopment of an ichneumon is to collect a few caterpillars 
from the wild, either by carefully looking on vegetation, 
or by using a beating tray (a sheet of material stretched 
over a frame used to catch insects dislodged by tapping 
a branch or bush with a stick). The caterpillars can be 
taken home with their food plant and observed until 
they pupate. Instead of a moth or butterfly, what pops 
its head from the chrysalis may be an adult ichneumon. 
Parasitic wasps, like ichneumons, are so effective at find- 
ing and inserting their eggs into their hosts that many 
collected caterpillars will be playing host to one of these 
wasp larvae. 




204 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


SACCULINA 


Sacculina — A female sacculina grows like the 
roots of a plant into every part of a crab’s body. 

(Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Sacculina carcini 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Cirripedia 
Order: Rhizocephala 
Family: Sacculinidae 

What does it look like? These bizarre barnacles are saclike in form; they lack all appendages 
and don’t have any obvious segmentation. The adult female resembles the branching roots 
of a plant. The adult male has no distinct form as he essentially becomes part of the female 
once inside the host. 

Where does it live? This animal is found wherever the green shore crab is found, normally the 
intertidal zone and very shallow water. 

The Crab’s Nemesis 

The crustaceans are normally regarded as quite benign animals, familiar to us as crabs, prawns, 
shrimps, and lobsters, yet among their numbers are some very interesting parasites, which can 
only be described as remarkable, Sacculina is one of these. It is a type of barnacle, and its host 
is the shore crab. A young female Sacculina finds its host and hooks onto it using the feelers 
at the front of her body. The parasite goes for the base of one the crab’s hairs or another part 
of the host’s body where the exoskeleton is thin, such as the thin membrane between the leg 
segments. This larva undergoes metamorphosis, losing all of its limbs and other crustacean 
characteristics to become what is essentially a living syringe capable of injecting a cuticle- 
clad mass of cells into the crab. The clump of cells migrates to one of the crab’s nerve cords 
where it grows like the roots of a plant, eventually branching out through most of the host’s 
body, absorbing nutrients from the crab’s blood. Once fully grown inside its host, the para- 
site can apply itself to reproduction, involving the formation of an external brood chamber 
resembling the egg mass of the female host. The female parasite, her branches snaking their 




Sacculina — The brown, globular egg-sac of the para- 
site can be seen protruding from beneath the crab’s 
abdomen. As the crab cannot shed its exoskeleton, 
barnacles have taken up residence. (Adam Petrusek) 


LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 205 


way into every part of the unlucky crab, 
then awaits the arrival of a male. As luck 
would have it, a suitor alights on the crab 
and enters the brood chamber in the same 
way the female parasite got inside the 
host — self injection. The injected cells be- 
come a spine-covered larva that migrates 
to a special chamber in the female before 
developing into a testis. With the male 
now in place and ready to produce sperm, 
the parasite can apply itself to producing 
the yellowish, spongy brood chamber, 
which protrudes from beneath the crab’s 
abdomen. 

The effects of the parasitism on the crab 
are severe. For instance, it can no longer molt its exoskeleton, which is how all crustaceans grow. 
Also, the parasite absorbs so much nourishment from the crabs body that there is not enough for 
the sex organs to mature sufficiently, and the host is sterilized, although it is possible that sub- 
stances produced by the parasite may also account for this. Interestingly, the crab host will behave 
as if the parasite’s egg mass is its own, protecting and cleaning it and maintaining a flow of water 
around it to provide the developing parasite larvae with sufficient oxygen. It is highly likely that 
the parasite is responsible for this behavior, producing substances that control the crab. 

Even if the parasite develops in a male crab, the above behavior is played out as the male is 
turned into a female due to the constricting effect of Sacculina on the male’s genitals. 

♦ Barnacles are very interesting animals. They are all marine and are the only sessile 
crustaceans. Until around 1830, they were thought to be mollusks, related to animals 
like limpets and snails. The vast majority of barnacles encrust rocks and the like; how- 
ever, there are some barnacles (i.e,, Sacculina) that have forsaken the typical barnacle 
existence and live in the bodies of other sea creatures. 

♦ There are many barnacle species that live on or in the bodies of other marine animals; 
thus making the evolutionary step from commensal to parasitic a relatively small one. 
Parasitism is just a small part of a continuum of interactions between different organ- 
isms, including phoresis, commensalism, symbiosis, and so forth. 

♦ The host crab is so duped by Sacculina’s scheme that it will even perform spawning 
behavior when the parasites offspring are ready to emerge. It is thought that the para- 
site produces chemicals controlling this behavior. The misguided tender loving care 
shown by the crab for the parasites young is essential. The parasite brood chamber of 
crabs that are not able to offer cleaning services soon become diseased. 

♦ As if the relationship between the crab and Sacculina weren’t complicated enough, 
nature heaps another layer of complexity on top: Sacculina is also parasitized and by 
another type of crustacean.

^ Go Look! 

If you go to the beach, you can try to look for these para- 
sitic barnacles by searching for crabs at low tide. A crab 
parasitized by Sacculina will have lots of encrusting ma- 
terial on its shell as it cannot shed its skin. The brood 
chamber of the parasite can be seen by turning the crab 
over. A smooth, yellowish or brown sac may be found 
poking out from the beneath the abdominal plates of the 
crab, and you can tell if it is a Sacculina egg mass or not 
as a crabs egg mass is granular rather than smooth. Sac - 
culina parasitizes up to 50 percent of crabs, depending on 
the location, so you have a good chance of finding some 
of these very interesting crustaceans.

STREPSIPTERANS 



Stylopids — The head end of female 
strepsipterans emerges from between the 
abdominal plates of an unlucky wasp. 
(Mike Shanahan) 


Stylopids — A preserved, adult male strepsipteran. 
Note the elaborate antennae, unusual hind wings 
and the fore wings, which are reduced to club-like 
structures called halteres. (Ross Piper) 



Scientific name: Strepsipterans 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Strepsiptera 
Family: several families 

What do they look like? These are small insects; adult males of the largest species are around 
5 mm in length. The females are grublike without any discernible features, whereas the 
short-lived males have large, delicate wings, protruding raspberry-like eyes, and antler-like 
antennae. The first pair of wings is hugely reduced, forming small, club-shaped structures 
called halteres. 

Where do they live? These insects are found all around the world in all kinds of habitats, 

wherever there are suitable hosts for their development. They are very difficult to find due to 
their small size and specialist ways. 

A Pocket Parasite 

The strepsipterans are a unique group of parasitic insects. The adult males and females are very 
different in appearance, but both start their life as a small, hyperactive larva, scooting freely around 
in the body cavity of their mother. When the time comes to leave, they exit the body cavity through 
a genital pore and move down a narrow brood canal to the outside world. The female produces so 
many young that the vegetation where they are released becomes a bustle of squirming and jump- 
ing larvae, all eager to find a host, A safe bet for a host is a bee or a wasp, but this depends on the 




LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 207 


species of strepsipteran in question. The jostling larvae make for flowers, which may be visited by 
bees and wasps foraging for nectar and pollen. When an insect that is the right size, shape, and 
color for a bee or wasp comes within range of the larva, it uses the long, stiff paired bristles at its 
hind end to launch itself into the air with the hope of hitting the buzzing insect, which it cling 
on to for dear life with its clawed feet. The bee or wasp, unperturbed by the presence of its new 
passenger, heads back to its nest to feed its own larvae with the food it collected on its foraging 
trip. Once in the nest of the host, the strepsipteran larva disembarks from the ride it hitched and 
makes for one of the plump wasp grubs in its little cell. The tiny parasite creeps along the body 
of the host until it reaches a spot it can burrow into. Using enzymes, the parasite larva dissolves 
the skin of the host and sinks into its body, wriggling furiously as it goes. This frantic squirming 
separates the various layers of the hosts skin, forming a pocket that the parasite slips into. Its 
place inside the host now secured, the larva goes through its first metamorphosis, turning into a 
grublike larva. All the nourishment it requires is obtained from the bodily fluids of the host, and 
the little skin pocket ensures the growing parasite is safe from the dreaded rigors of the hosts im- 
mune system. Feeding on the fluids of the host, the strepsipteran larva grows, eventually taking up 
most of the space in the hosts abdomen. The effect of this parasitism on the fully grown host is 
not to be sneezed at. The sexual organs of the adult wasp do not have room to mature due to the 
space taken up by the young parasite. The host develops into adulthood but it is very damaged; 
it is sterilized and sexless, and from between the tough plates of its abdomen protrudes the head 
end of a strepsipteran pupa. Soon after the ravaged host begins its normal adult activities, the cap 
of the parasite pupa opens and out pops an adult male strepsipteran. His mouthparts are small 
and useless, and the energy reserves he built up as a larva will not sustain him for long, so he must 
seek out a mate as quickly as possible. His mate is nothing like him. She found her own host in 
the same way as the male, but she still looks like a grub and is still to be found in the host insect 
with her head end projecting from its abdomen. The male is attracted to the scent of his unsavory 
mate and copulates with her by introducing his sperm into her brood canal, the entrance to which 
is found just behind her head. The sperm fertilizes the female’s eggs, and before long, a new gen- 
eration of mobile larvae will be ready to begin the complex cycle all over again. 

♦ Around 600 species of strepsipteran have been identified, but their small size and the 
fact that they are rarely encountered means that there are probably many more species 
yet to be discovered. 

♦ They parasitize a huge range of insects: 34 families in 7 orders, including bees, wasps, 
leafhoppers, grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches, and silverfish. The ability of strep- 
sipterans to parasitize a diverse range of hosts mystified scientists for a long time, as 
other parasitic insects are restricted to a small range of hosts because of the difficul- 
ties of eluding or overcoming the varied immune systems of different insects. The key 
to the strepsipterans’ varied tastes is the pocket of host cuticle it lives in as a larva. 

This little pocket shields the strepsipteran larva from the substances and cells that 
make up the host’s immune system. 

♦ The complex life cycle of these parasites also took many years to unravel. They are 
among only a few insects that go through the process of hypermetamorphosis. This is 
where the egg hatches into a highly active, mobile larva (triungulin) with eyes and legs 
before undergoing a transformation into a typical, limbless grublike larva. It is this 
larva that pupates and metamorphoses into the adult insect.

♦ The best way to find strepsipterans is by using some form of trap. In the warm trop- 
ics, the adult males are active at night and are attracted to light; therefore, a moth trap 
should bring in a few specimens, but as they are so small, an alcohol-filled collecting 
tube may be needed beneath the trap to ensnare the males. The females will only be 
seen if the host is found, although there is one group of these parasites where both 
the adult males and females are free living. Under a microscope, the delicate and 
graceful appearance of the male can be appreciated, from the large, fine wings to the 
unusual eyes, which are unique in the invertebrate world. Unlike the compound eye 
of an insect, which forms a mosaic image, a male strepsipteran has a series of eyelets, 
each of which forms an entire image.

WARBLE FLIES

Shanahan) 



Warble Flies — A female reindeer warble fly photo-

Scientific name; Hypoderma species 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Diptera 
Family: Oestridae 

What do they look like? An adult warble fly is around 13 mm long and bears a striking re- 
semblance to a small bumblebee. It is a hairy insect with yellowish white fur on its head and 
thorax, and alternating bands of light and dark hair on its abdomen. 

Where do they live? The warble fly is very widely distributed throughout the northern hemi- 
sphere, ranging from the United States through Europe and into Asia, Its habitat is grass- 
land and wood pasture where cattle are reared. 



LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 209 


Nipping at the Heels 

During the long, lazy days of summer, large grazing mammals are a magnet for flies of every 
description. Some come to drink the cow’s sweat, others to lap at wounds, while still others come 
to make use of the abundant dung produced by these animals. A swish of the tail is normally 
enough to keep this irritating swarm at bay. Apart from being an annoyance, these flies are not 
that dangerous and are largely tolerated by the cattle. The warble fly, however, is feared by cattle, 
and to get close to their quarry, these flies must employ some very cunning means. Before they 
get within earshot of their target cow, female warble flies will take to the ground and cover the 
remaining distance in a series of hops before crawling up the animal’s leg. Carefully, the female 
lays numerous 1 mm, pallid eggs that look like miniature grains of rice. Each of these eggs is at- 
tached to the hairs of the host by a small stalk. Within a week, tiny larvae have hatched from the 
eggs. These grubs make straight for the skin of the beast and delve into a hair follicle where they 
use digestive enzymes and their paired mouth hooks to break through the skin in to the tissue 
beneath. There, underneath the tough hide of the animal, they embark on a fascinating migra- 
tion. Using their mouth hooks, they excavate a tunnel in the flesh of the cow, growing as they 
feed on the nutritious material. They slowly but steadily make their way toward the head of the 
animal, but when they reach the esophagus in the neck, they a rest for a while and then make an 
about-turn for no particular reason and head for the rear of their relatively gigantic host. They 
tunnel back to the rear of the animal through the muscular tissue of the back. They are about 
10 mm long when they arrive at the lumbar region of the cattle’s back, and it is here that they 
cut a small hole in the animal’s hide and turn around so that their rear end, with its breathing 
tubes, is facing the small hole. The feeding larvae produce a very obvious, raised lump, and it 
is these lumps that are known as warbles. With their heads down in the back muscle of the 
cattle, the larvae continue to feed and grow, held in place by a number of spines on their bodies. 
When they are around 30 mm in length, the grubs are mature, and they take their leave of the 
host and fall to the ground. The big wide world is no place for succulent grubs, so they quickly 
burrow into the soil and undergo metamorphosis in an earthen chamber. Pupation can take 
2-8 weeks, and at the end of this time, the perfectly formed adult flies emerge to seek out more 
hapless mammals. 

♦ Some warble flies make directly for their host on the wing without surreptitiously 
hopping along the ground. Host mammals are seemingly aware of the approach of 
these species and become, quite rightly, terrified. They run around in panic trying to 
get away from the flies and will often injure themselves by running into trees, fences, 
and water. This panicked behavior is known as gadding, and in some parts of the 
world these warble flies are known as gadflies. 

♦ The adult flies live for only around five days. They have no mouthparts and do not 
feed at all. 

♦ Although the warble flies are fascinating insects perfectly adapted to a parasitic way of 
life, it is no surprise that farmers the world over would like to see them eradicated. Even 
as far back as 1965, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that these flies were 
responsible for around $192 million of loss to the cattle industry. Exiting larvae damage 
the hides of infected animals, and the migrating larva make large cuts of meat worthless 



210 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


as the tunnels fill with what is known as butchers jelly. The cattle also lose weight and 
produce less milk when they are continually alarmed by the presence of these flies, 

♦ As the United Kingdom is a small island nation, it has almost managed to eradicate 
the warble fly which is quite unfortunate. The warble fly may have some very grisly 
habits, but it is a remarkable little animal that is able to exploit large mammals very 
effectively. 

♦ Warble fly larvae can be removed from their feeding nodule by being carefully 
squeezed out. Care must be taken not to rupture the grub as this can cause infections 
and severe immune reactions. 

♦ Interestingly, it is young host animals that are most susceptible to the ravages of the 
warble fly. It appears that older animals build up an immunity to the larval infections. 

♦ In those people who are often around grazing animals, it is rare, but not unknown 
for them to become parasitized by this fly. In cases of human infection, the effects are 
often gruesome as the larvae will end up in the head or the spinal column, causing the 
loss of an eye or paralysis of the legs.

Scientific name: Thalassoma bifasciatum 
Scientific classification:

What does it look like? The largest males of this fish species are around 80 mm long. They are 
very brightly colored, the males more so, but the vividness of their colors depends on their 
degree of development. The body is long and cigar shaped, and the pectoral fins are well 
developed. 




212 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? The blue-headed wrasse is a tropical fish of the western Atlantic, They 
can be found around Bermuda and the waters south of Florida, extending south to north- 
ern South America and west into the southeast area of the Gulf of Mexico, It is fond 
of reefs, although it can sometimes be seen in inshore bays and shallow sea grass beds. 

A Sex Change on the Caribbean Reef 

In the azure waters of the Caribbean, amid the ancient and elaborate coral reefs, live large schools 
of blue-headed wrasse. In common with most tropical reef fish, its blue head is strikingly col- 
ored, but what makes this little fish stand out from the rest of the reef community is its amazing 
social behavior. The adults of this fish are divided into three distinct types. There are females and 
not one, but two types of male: initial-phase males and terminal-phase males. The females and 
initial-phase males are yellow and white with dark stripes along their bodies. The terminal-phase 
males are larger and have a striking blue head, black-and-white markings behind the head and 
a shimmering, dark green body. On a prime bit of reef, it is possible to find a group of females 
that are ready and willing to breed. Overseeing these females is a terminal-phase male, jealously 
guarding his harem from the initial-phase males that try with all their guile to sneakily mate 
with the females, A large male will chase these interlopers, changing color to an intense metallic 
green as he does so to signal his aggression. When the threat has been dealt with, the male will 
turn his attentions to his harem, and quick-as-a-flash, his colors change once again, but this time 
to an opalescent pink-grey with distinctive black circles on his pectoral fins. The initial-phase 
males will, if they are lucky, grow up to become big, aggressive males with harems of their own. 
However, it is quite common for an aggressive male to get snapped up by a predator or sim- 
ply die of old age (guarding a harem is exhausting work!) with no worthy successor to take on 
his mantle. In this situation, a most extraordinary thing happens. The largest of the females in 
the harem sees her opportunity and goes through a rapid sex change to fill the vacant lordship. 
In a little more than a week, the female has grown and developed the colors and markings of 
the terminal-phase male. Not only does her appearance change, but her behavior changes from 
that of a meek, supplicant concubine to that of a domineering, aggressive harem owner. The sex 
change is more than skin deep as her reproductive organs also go through a massive transforma- 
tion to enable the production of sperm instead of eggs. This sex change is a one way trip, and the 
newly formed male can never change back into a female, 

♦ Sex changing is quite common in fish. The sex of the individual is not determined at 
fertilization, as in mammals, but changes as the individual grows and is controlled 
by genes and environmental conditions. Some species are truly hermaphroditic and 
can produce eggs and sperm at the same time. Even more bizarrely, there are some 
fish species that are all-female. They are normally hybrids of hermaphroditic species. 
Sperm is still required in all except the mangrove killifish (obtained from males of one 
of the parent species), but only to trigger the development of the embryo. There is 
absolutely no fusion of the DNA in the sperm with that contained in the egg, 

♦ The reef habitat may be able to support many of these fish, but suitable spawn- 
ing sites are in short supply, as they need to be situated in areas where the current 
is sufficiently strong enough to carry the fertilized eggs safely away from the shore. 
Because of their rarity, these spawning sites are coveted, and females will not leave 
them. The remarkable sex-changing behavior of this fish ensures that a female is able 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 213 


to take over a spawning ground and the harem of females, but only when she has had 
a good stint at reproducing young herself. 

♦ The sex-changing abilities of this fish were proved by curious scientists. They 
selectively removed the large, terminal-male fish from a spawning site and were able 
to show that within a week or two the largest female in the group had successfully 
changed sex, 

♦ The terminal-phase males are mating machines and can fertilize the eggs of more 
than 100 females a day if the spawning site that they guard is sufficiently attractive to 
members of the opposite sex, 

♦ Interestingly, the small initial-phase males of the blue-headed wrasse have 
comparatively larger testes than their larger, more aggressive brethren. This enables 
them to produce lots of sperm for the snatched opportunities they must take when 
trying to copulate with the females in the guarded harem. 

♦ Blue-headed wrasses eat a wide variety of animal food on the coral reef. They are 
partial to all manner of invertebrates, including worms and crustaceans. Outside of 
spawning time, packs of females and initial-phase males will stalk the reef searching 
for the nesting sites of nest-guarding fish. The blue-headed wrasses in their groups 
distract the nest guards and plunder the eggs before they are driven off. 

♦ Blue-headed wrasses, especially the initial-phase males are important sanitary species 
for the other reef fish. They remove parasites from fish that stop at so-called cleaning 
stations and cleanse injuries, promoting the healing process. Occasionally, the fish 
receiving the good turn will turn on the little wrasse and gobble it up. The menial task of 
cleaning for crumbs of food is beneath the terminal-phase males, whose well-developed 
teeth allow them to eat hard-shelled crustaceans and other reef invertebrates.

214 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Scientific name: Ampulex compressa 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Sphecidae 

What does it look like? The cockroach wasp is around 15-25 mm in length with long curving 
antennae, a large thorax, and an oval abdomen, which tapers towards the rear. The colors of 
this insect are very dramatic, as it can be a myriad of metallic blues and greens. 

Where does it live? The wasp is native to the tropical forests of Africa and is also found in 
India and some of the Pacific Islands. 

Taming the Quarry 

In many species of venomous animals, the poison injected via a sting or a bite has evolved into 
much more than just a means of killing prey and predators. In some insects, the venom has 
become so sophisticated that it controls the behavior of the prey, affecting its movement and 
activity. The cockroach wasp is one such insect. This small flying jewel preys exclusively on the 
much maligned cockroach. Using its powerful senses, it homes in on one of these unwary pests 
and administers two stings. When delivering a sting, the wasp faces the cockroach and curves 
its flexible abdomen around to inject the venom. The first of these stings is directed to the tiny 
nodes of the central nervous system located in the insect’s thorax. These minibrains control the 
cockroach’s legs, and the wasp’s venom blocks their activity, paralyzing the victim. This paralysis 
is only temporary, lasting for about 2-5 minutes. This is more than enough time for the wasp 
to deliver its second sting, which requires the skill and precision of a brain surgeon. Using its 
very sensitive sting, it delivers a tiny dose of venom to a region of the cockroach’s brain, which 
affects, among other things, its escape reflex. When it eventually recovers from the paralysis 
of the first sting, the cockroach does not try to flee for the nearest cover, but grooms itself 
excessively for around 30 minutes, while the wasp scuttles off to look for a suitable lair. When 
the wasp returns, it bites off one of the long antennae of the cockroach before lapping at the 
hemolymph (insect blood) that flows from the severed appendage. Then the wasp grabs the 
cockroach by one of its antennae stumps and takes it for a walk, like a very docile pet, leading it 
to the refuge the wasp found earlier. There, the wasp lays a single egg on the stupefied host. The 
cockroach, essentially incapacitated but still alive is sealed in this hideaway with small stones 
and other debris, not to prevent it from escaping (it has no urge to!), but to keep it safe from 
predators. The wasp larva hatches to find itself sitting on a mound of self-cleaning food, which 
it starts tucking into. After two days, the young larva is big enough to tunnel into the host, and 
after four or five days, the voracious feeding of the larva takes its toll, and the cockroach dies. 
After about eight days, the wasp larva is ready to pupate, and it spins itself a silken cocoon 
inside the drying carcass of the cockroach. The adult hatches after about four weeks and leaves 
the lifeless husk of its host, 

♦ There are around 200 species of cockroach wasps, all of which parasitize cockroach 
species, 

♦ The cockroach wasp is a parasite of the American cockroach ( Periplaneta americana), 
which, confusingly, is actually a native of tropical Africa that has been accidentally 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 215 


transported around the world. It is one of the cockroaches much maligned by people, 
and it is an unwelcome guest in dwellings everywhere, 

♦ Because the jewel wasp preys on the American cockroach, it was introduced to 
Hawaii in 1941 as a biological control agent of this pesky species. Unfortunately, this 
scheme was not very successful as the wasp is very territorial and the areas in which 
they hunt are normally quite small. 

♦ The stinger of the jewel wasp, like that of other wasps, is a modified egg-laying tube. 
On its surface, there are a number of microscopic sense organs allowing the wasp 

to use it like a precision instrument. These receptors are used to good effect to hit a 
target in the tiny brain of the cockroach. 

♦ The mind-bending venom of this wasp does not directly control the movements of 
the cockroach. It just renders the cockroach easily led so the parasitoid can lead it like 
a mild-mannered hound. 

♦ Many parasitic wasps tackle hosts that can be carried to a suitable brood chamber. 

The mind-controlling venom of the wasp allows it to use a host that is much too large 
to be carried away. 

♦ If offered other insects similar in size to the American cockroach, the jewel wasp will 
give them a cursory once over but make no attempt to sting them. 

♦ Other types of parasitoid wasps inject venom directly into the central nervous system of 
their host, but the jewel wasp is the only known animal that targets the brain specifically. 

♦ The blood-brain barrier of animals stops chemicals from entering the brain. The 
stinging strategy of the wasp overcomes this obstacle. 

♦ Grooming is fundamentally important to all insects. Using their feet, they can 
rigorously clean their entire body. This behavior allows them to keep their exoskel- 
eton free of potentially disease-causing microorganisms, 

♦ It is possible to mimic the effect of the jewel wasp’s venom by conducting a small 
operation on the cockroach’s brain, but the result is nowhere near as subtle as the 
chemicals introduced by the parasitoid.

DEEP-SEA ANGLER FISH 

Scientific name: Ceratioids 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Lophiiformes 
Family: many families 

What do they look like? Probably the best word to describe the deep-sea angler fish is 
grotesque. Many species looks like a swimming head. They are often coal black, and the 



216 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Deep-Sea Angler Fish — A fierce looking female deep-sea angler fish with a tiny, withered 
male attached to her side. (Mike Shanahan) 


large mouth bristles with savage looking fangs. On the top of their head there is a thin stalk 
ending in a quill-like structure. They vary in size from species as big as a baby’s fist to larger, 
football-sized specimens. The males are many times smaller than the females. 

Where do they live? These are deep-sea animals, found at depths of at least 1,000 m, the most 
common habitat in the world’s oceans. They are found throughout the world’s oceans. 

Joined at the Hip 

The deep-sea must rank as one of the most exceptional habitats. It is pitch black, and the pres- 
sure, due to the great weight of water above, is immense. Also, these waters never feel the warm- 
ing rays of the sun and are therefore very cold. If the dark, the pressure, and cold were not 
enough, there is also very little food down in the depths, but as is always the case, life has found 
a way, and these foreboding places with their exceptional circumstances are inhabited by an array 
of exceptional animals. The deep-sea angler fish is a perfect example. It is not a looker, but what 
it lacks in appearance, it more than makes up for in sheer peculiarity. Its small, seemingly 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 217 


malformed body is perfectly adapted to this harsh world. Food is so scarce in the depths that 
the deep-sea angler fish has come up with a means of attracting what little there is. Lures on its 
head emit an eerie greenish/blue glow. These beacons attract other, curious animals of the deep. 
This fish cannot afford to miss a potential meal, and its long, needle-like teeth ensure that any 
slippery customers investigating its lure are well and truly impaled. 

Food is not the only thing difficult to come by in the depths. Mates are also very hard to find, 
and these fish have evolved to make sure that whenever they find a mate, they never lose them. 
The tiny males, after they hatch, swim freely in the water, but their gut is useless for feeding; 
therefore, the race is on to find a mate before they starve. They detect the scent of a female in the 
water and track it to its source. If they are lucky enough to find a member of the opposite sex, 
they dispense with the common pleasantries of courtship and grab on to her with their teeth. As 
they are so small, they hardly interfere with the females slow progress through the water. The 
male, latched on to his gigantic mate’s flank, releases an enzyme that breaks down the skin of 
his mouth and that of the female’s, all the way down to the blood supply. Slowly but surely, the 
skin and the blood supply of the male fuses with that of his partner. Nourished by his partner’s 
blood, the male has no need to feed, and his organs eventually begin to degenerate until he is 
little more than a sperm-producing appendage of the female. He may not be the only male car- 
ried by the female, as several more may be latched on to the rear portion of her body, all produc- 
ing sperm to fertilize her eggs, 

♦ There are many species of angler fish, and a significant number live in deep water. 
Exceedingly little is known about what these fish do in the wild. They are only ever 
caught in deep trawl nets and occasionally observed using submersibles. New species 
are caught and identified regularly, and as exploration of the deep sea continues, more 
species will undoubtedly be found. 

♦ In all species of deep-sea angler fish, the first spine of the dorsal fin is modified to 
form the lure used to attract prey. The light from this lure is not produced by the 
fish, but by marine bacteria, which enter the fish’s lure through small vents. Floating 
about in the sea water, these bacteria never emit light as they are never found in 
high enough densities, but safely inside the fish, they can multiply rapidly, producing 
chemicals that eventually reach high enough concentrations to trigger the production 
of an eerie glow. 

♦ The production of light is actually quite common in nature. Many deep-sea creatures 
do it, as do many land invertebrates and fungi. Whether this light is produced 

by a fish or a glowworm, the chemicals involved are quite similar. All hinge on a 
substance called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. The enzyme breaks down 
the luciferin, releasing light as a by-product. Normal light bulbs can only turn about 
2 percent of the energy they use into light, with the rest being wasted as heat. Light 
from a biological source is produced much more efficiently than man-made light, as 
approximately 95 percent of the energy used is turned into light, 

♦ The intense pressure, low temperature, and perpetual dark of the deep sea make it a 
hard place to live; therefore, animals like the deep-sea angler fish grow very slowly and 
are normally small. The age at which they reach sexual maturity is comparable to that 
seen in humans, and they probably live for many decades. The conditions and limited 
food means they are emaciated animals, their tissues containing little in the way of 



218 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


protein. The stomach and bones of these fish are also very flexible, enabling them to 
swallow prey that may be twice their size, 

♦ Deep-sea angler fish and other animals of the depths migrate vertically on a daily 
basis. During the day they stay deep, but during the night, they rise up to take 
advantage of more abundant prey in the near-surface waters. Exactly what cues these 
animals base their movements on is a mystery. They cant be sensing the onset of 
twilight, as light does not penetrate very far into water. 

♦ The deep sea, in terms of area, is the commonest habitat on earth, but startlingly, less 
than 1 percent of it has been explored. It is often said that we know more about the 
surface of the moon than the deep sea. To put this in context, over the last 50 years or 
so, countless man-hours and huge sums of money have been thrown at a dead lump 
of rock in space, while all around us there is a unknown ecosystem inhabited by a 
dizzying array of bizarre organisms. Only through the cameras of a submersible can 
we snatch glimpses of this mysterious world. 


GREEN SPOON WORM 



Green Spoon Worm — A green spoon worm female dwarfs the male (inset and magnified). (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Bonellia viridis 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Echiura 
Order: Echiuroidea 
Family: Bonellidae 

What does it look like? The body of the female is around 8 cm long, green or blue/ green, sau- 
sage shaped, and covered in small lumps. The female also has a long proboscis, which, when 
fully extended, can be up to 2 m long. The male on the other hand is tiny, only 1-2 mm long. 

Where does it live? The green spoon worm is a marine invertebrate, a denizen of the shore in 
northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. The females are found in areas where the 
surface is hard, with crevices in which they can hide. 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 219 


Living inside Your Mate 

Sex is one of the biggest conundrums in the animal kingdom, but regardless of its true origins 
and function, male and female animals are often quite distinct in appearance and lifestyle. No- 
where is this more apparent than in the green spoon worm, a species in which for many years the 
male was unknown. It was thought the species had no need of males and could reproduce with- 
out sex, but after many fruitless searches, the males were discovered — and they were very differ- 
ent from the females. Female green spoon worms are about the same size and shape as a gherkin, 
but with the addition of a long, thin proboscis. The males on the other hand can only just be 
seen with the naked eye. They are about 1-2 mm long, slipper shaped, and covered in a coat of 
hairlike material. Most interestingly of all, though, is the fact they live inside the female. Up to 
30 tiny males, many hundreds of times smaller than their mate and bearing no similarity to her 
whatsoever, live in a special chamber called the androecium where they absorb all of the food they 
need from the fluids they are bathed in. The males are concerned solely with the taxing job of 
producing sperm, and their bodies contain the organs needed to produce this prized substance, 
but precious little else. The males are in a prime position to fertilize the massive partner’s eggs, 
and they also help out by producing a substance that sticks the eggs together. 

The eggs are kept inside the females body until the larvae hatch, after which they drift in the cur- 
rent near the seabed. After seven days, they begin to settle. Unlike the vast majority of other animals, 
the gender of a spoon worm is not determined by its genes, but by its environment — more specifi- 
cally, the proximity of a female. Should one of these young spoon worms settle on a female of the 
same species, it will become a male. It will then grow a sucker and migrate to the females androecium 
where it will be given free room and board in return for fertilizing eggs. Young spoon worms that 
settle away from others of their species grow into adult females over a period of two years. 

Why should the sex of this little sea creature be determined in such a bizarre way? The 
chances of a male finding a mate are slim, which is also the case for the chances of a female 
worm finding an empty burrow. The ability to decide on a gender at the last moment gives 
this species a degree of flexibility, enabling the larval worm to make the best of the situation in 
which it finds itself. 

♦ There are around 140 known species of spoon worms, although there are probably 
many more to be identified, especially in the deep ocean, 

♦ Spoon worms are marine, although there are a few Indian species that live in brackish 
water. Typically, they are inhabitants of the shore, but several species have been 
collected at great depths. They excavate burrows in the seabed or make use of crevices 
in rock. They will also inhabit empty shells and the spaces between the roots of 
mangrove trees. Due to their secretive nature, very little is known about spoon worms. 
Normally, the only visible part of the animal is the elongated proboscis, which in 
some species can be extended to 100 times the length of the body trunk. 

♦ These animals feed on particles of edible matter by sweeping their long proboscis 
across the seafloor. The proboscis can be extended, but not withdrawn into the body 
of the spoon worm. The food particles are trapped in sticky mucus covering the 
proboscis, and in a conveyor belt fashion, the mucus is moved by cilia to a furrow that 
runs the length of this structure. The particles are transported to the mouth of the 
animal where they are ingested. Some species also use their proboscis to scoop up 
detritus, while others produce a mucus net from it to trap food.

♦ Spoon worms in the right conditions can be reasonably common, and as a result, they 
can be important components of the marine food chain. Although it is known that 
Bonellia viridis does contain a neurotoxin in its skin, spoon worms in general are easy 
targets for a range of marine predators. 

♦ These animals do not have the segmented bodies of true worms, but the two groups 
are closely related, indicated by the similarity of their larvae. New evidence obtained 
from the study of DNA indicates spoon worms and true worms may be much more 
closely related than currently believed. 

♦ Gender determination in some reptiles and fish is similar to that of the spoon worms.

NARWHAL 

\S,-' V- •' til*. v-'_- 


Narwhal — A skull of a narwhal showing its curious tusk. (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific name: Monodon monoceros 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Cetacea 
Family: Monodontidae 

What does it look like? The narwhal is a small whale. The males are around 5 m in length and 
up to 1,600 kg in weight. The females are slightly smaller. The back of the torpedo-shaped 
body is mottled black and white, and the underside is white. There is no dorsal fin. The male 
has a distinctive spiral tusk. 

Where does it live? This whale is found in northern temperate and Arctic waters, typically 
among the drifting and pack ice around northern Russia, the United States, Canada, and 
Greenland. 

A Curious Tooth and the Legend of the Unicorn 

The narwhal is one of the most fabled whale species. Pods, numbering more than 2,000 individu- 
als, cruise the northern seas spending a lot of their time beneath the ice. Because they live in inac- 
cessible areas, few people have ever seen a living narwhal, and even fewer can get close enough to 
study and observe these mysterious beasts. The single most unusual characteristic of the narwhal 
is the large tusk brandished by the males and, very rarely, the females. Like the tusk of an elephant, 
the growth is actually a modified tooth, and it is unique in the animal kingdom for being the only 




THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 221 


straight tusk and the only spiral tooth. The animal has two teeth, but it is normally the left one 
that becomes a tusk with its counterclockwise spiral. In some large males, the tusk may reach a 
length of 3 m, its handsome spiral clearly visible. It protrudes from the left upper lip and is some- 
times skewed off in awkward directions. A very small proportion of males have a pair of tusks. 

Not only does this structure look fantastic, but no one is entirely sure exactly what it is for. There 
are a number of theories. Some people believe the tusk is actually a tool for finding food, used by 
the whale to probe the seabed for crustaceans, mollusks, and worms. Others suggest the tusk is a 
fishing spear, used by the whale to impale fish as it hunts in the cold Arctic waters, or that it is used 
as a means of making breathing holes in the sea ice. Another common theory is that the tusk is used 
like a sword in jousts between males during the breeding season. Jousting! Perhaps not, but as the 
tusk is an adornment almost unique to males, it does lend some credibility to this theory. Many 
other male animals have hugely exaggerated features, such as the elaborate antlers of male deer, the 
mandibles and mouthparts of certain insects and spiders, not to mention the ludicrously flamboy- 
ant plumage of some male birds, which are used to attract females during the breeding season. 

More recently, dentists working in the United States have been intrigued by the narwhal and 
its mysterious tusk. They have proposed that the tusk is actually a sensory organ. They found 
over 10 million tiny nerve channels stretching from the core of the tusk to its outer surface. Per- 
haps the nerve channels are sensing chemicals in the water or the distinctive electrical field of its 
prey. Whatever the actual function of the bizarre tusk, it is very likely that its sensory function is 
entwined with some aspect of the whale’s breeding behavior. 

Further observations will reveal the true function of this unique tooth, but as the narwhal 
is protected and very difficult to observe, it may be sometime yet before we unravel the mystery 
completely. 

♦ The narwhal’s closest relative is the white beluga whale. The two animals are found in 
the same locations, and sometimes they may be seen in the same Arctic estuaries, 

♦ The unusual appearance and rarity of the tusk has intrigued people for centuries. 

Their sporadic appearance in medieval Europe gave rise to an abundance of legends. 
The legend of the unicorn probably arose from the fertile imagination of a medieval 
storyteller who had once seen or been told of the narwhal’s tusk. Centuries ago, the real 
animal would have been unknown to all except the Inuit of its native habitat. Stories 
would have quickly grown up around these peculiar creatures, 

♦ One of the most cherished possessions of Elizabeth I, Queen of England, was said 
to be narwhal tusk given to her as a gift. In medieval times, these objects were so rare 
that they were more valuable, pound for pound, than gold. They were thought to have 
miraculous curative properties, 

♦ Today, the narwhal is a protected species, but the tusks, coveted by collectors and 
museums the world over, still change hands for several thousand U.S. dollars. 

♦ The name narwhal is thought to come from the Scandinavian word nar, meaning “corpse,” 
The narwhal’s mottled coloration is said to look like that of a decaying human body. 

♦ The narwhal is a deep-diving whale and can reach depths of at least 1,200 m. 
Underneath its skin, there is thick layer of blubber as much 10 cm thick to provide 
insulation against the numbingly cold waters. The narwhal can produce a wide range 
of sounds, some of which are beyond the range of human hearing and are probably 
used to detect underwater obstacles and food by echolocation. 



222 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ As the narwhal ages, the tips of its flippers and tail fluke curl inward. 

♦ There are thought to be around 50,000 narwhal in the cold seas of the north, and 
about 1,000 are killed every year by Inuit hunters for their meat and skin. The chewy 
meat of the narwhal, known as muktuk, is an important source of vitamin C for the 
native people and their sled dogs, 

♦ Even though the narwhal can use the back of its head to break through the ice to 
make breathing holes, it can occasionally become stuck and suffocate. Large numbers 
of narwhal can also become trapped by encroaching sea ice during the winter. 

♦ The narwhal has few predators to fear, but it is vulnerable to attacks by marauding 
killer whales, and the young may also be attacked by walruses and polar bears.

PALOLO WORMS 



Palolo Worms — An adult palolo worm with its body divided into the atoke and epitoke. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Eunice species 
Scientific classification: 
Phylum: Annelida 
Class: Polychaeta 
Order: Aciculata 
Family: Eunicidae 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 223 


What do they look like? These worms display the segmentation that is common to all 
the annelids (polychaetes, earthworms, and leeches). When fully grown, they can be 
approximately 1 m in length. The head end bears sensory tentacles and complex jaws. 

Where do they live? Palolo worms are found around the world in tropical and subtropical seas. 
They normally live below the low-water mark in coral and rocky crevices, although some 
species build burrows in the mud or sand of the seabed. 

Severing the Body for the Species 

For much of the year, the Palolo worm, safe in its rocky or coral crevice, looks like any other sed- 
entary polychaete, its body divided into a long series of identical segments. The worm in this stage 
of its life is called the atoke, which is asexual and cannot breed. However, with the changing sea- 
sons, the time is right for breeding, and soon the worm’s appearance undergoes a radical transfor- 
mation. From the rear of the worm, new, highly modified segments start to grow, until a long chain 
of these identical units hangs from the rear of the atoke. This new and completely different section 
of the worm is called the epitoke, and it is this part that is involved in the process of reproduction. 

The segments of the epitoke are exact replicas of one another, and each is packed with eggs 
and sperm. On the surface of the epitoke segment there is a single eyespot; however, this is 
not an organ for discriminating shapes and detail, but rather for telling night from day. Huge 
numbers of these worms, with their epitokes fully formed, wait in their refuges for a specific 
cue to spawn. The cue is the moon, and in October or November, at the beginning of the last 
lunar quarter, all the worms release their epitokes at the same time. The epitokes, free of the 
atoke, swim with undulations of their spaghetti-like form to the surface of the sea, and as the 
sun rises (detected by the eyespot), they burst, releasing their eggs and sperm. The sea, close to 
shore, will be a soup of gametes. The eggs are fertilized rapidly, and by the next day, tiny larvae 
have formed. After drifting for two or three days, these offspring begin to settle and find rocky 
hideaways of their own where they will develop into adult worms in preparation for the next 
year’s mass spawning. The atoke, still in its burrow, will regenerate a new epitoke for the follow- 
ing year’s breeding season. 

♦ The polychaete worms, of which the Palolo worms are one type, are very common 
invertebrates, but as with many smaller animals, their secretive lives result in being 
overlooked by the casual observer. There are about 9,000 species of these worms, 
which are mostly marine, although a few species are found in soil and freshwater. 

Most are rather small animals, but the Palolo worm, Eunice gigantean, can be over 3 m 
in length. Some of the species are beautifully colored in shimmering reds, pinks, and 
greens. They can be active detritivores, scavengers or hunters (errant polychaetes), or 
burrow dwelling (sedentary polychaetes). It has been calculated that the burrowing 
polychaetes living on the seabed turn over more than 4,500 tonnes of mud per hectare 
of seafloor each year. 

♦ The synchronized release of the epitokes by Palolo worms is greatly anticipated 
by the people who live in the areas where these animals occur. Eunice viridis (the 
Samoan Palolo worm) is a particular favorite among the people of Samoa, who wait 
for spawning before wading into the shallows with torches to collect the spaghetti-like 
epitokes with whatever equipment they can find. Many simply eat the epitokes raw as 
they are taken from the water, although great quantities are taken ashore where they 



224 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


are boiled, baked, stewed, or fried and eaten in a range of dishes. Epitokes on toast is 
a particular favorite, 

♦ A relative of the Samoan Palolo worm, Eunice fucata (the Atlantic Palolo worm), 
synchronizes its breeding for the second or third day before the third quarter of the 
moon, sometime in June or July. 

♦ Another species of polychaete, Odontosyllis enopla, found in the West Indies and 
Bermuda, also swarms. However, in this species, there are separate males and females. 
In the summer, 50 to 60 minutes after sunset and up to 12 days following a full moon, 
the worms swim from the seabed to the surface where they start to glow. They swim 
around and around each other, forming small circles of light in the water. 

♦ Epitoky and swarming is quite common among the polychaetes. This phenomenon 
makes it possible for a population of worms, which live out their adult lives on 
the seabed in dispersed populations, to come together briefly for the purposes of 
reproduction. Swarming is a way of increasing the chances of fertilization. 

♦ The synchrony of the worm’s breeding is controlled by the lunar cycle — the effect the 
moons gravitational field has on the earth. Exactly what the worms are detecting is 
unknown, but many animals, especially those in the seas, synchronize their activities 
with the waxing and waning of the moon. The influence of the moon on the earth 
follows a predictable pattern; therefore, it is unsurprising that many organisms have 
taken to using it as a kind of timer.

POCKETBOOK MUSSELS 

Scientific name: Lampsilis species 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Mollusca 
Class: Bivalvia 
Order: Unionoida 
Family: Unionidae 

What do they look like? These mollusks have a pair of shells (valves) that completely envelope the 
body, linked by a strong, hinge ligament. The head of these mussels is very poorly developed 
because they are sessile and have little need of sense organs to find food and detect danger. 
The gills in these animals are normally very large and are involved not only in gas exchange 
but also assist in feeding. When fully grown, the shells of these mollusks can be 10 cm across. 

Where do they live? These animals are typically found in the sediment or gravel of shallow, 
clean freshwater streams and rivers. They are native primarily to temperate waterways of the 
United States, 

A Fishy Mollusk 

Adult pocketbook mussels are sedentary. They wait for food to come to them, filtering edible 

particles from the water. This is a very low-energy lifestyle, but it presents difficulties when it 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 225 



Pocketbook Mussels — A curious fish gets doused with larval pocketbook mussels when it investigates the 
mollusk’s intriguing mantle. (Mike Shanahan) 

comes to the dispersal of young. The adult female cannot disperse her young far and wide. To 
counter this, the pocketbook mussels use a very interesting ploy. They let other animals disperse 
their young for them. 

The eggs of these mollusks develop inside the female into small larvae called glochidia. These 
range in size from 0.2 to 0.5 mm, with two simple valves. The larvae remain inside the gill of 
their mother where they are neatly packed in what look like shelves. The female then goes 
about attracting a ride for her young. The edge of her body, which protrudes from between 
the valves of her shell, develops into an astounding mimic of a small fish, complete with mark- 
ings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of fish. Some fish 
are attracted to it and get closer because they see the mollusk’s adornment as prey, while others 
approach because they see it is a shoal member or a potential mate. When the fish moves in 
closer or nips the decoy, the female releases huge numbers of her larvae from her gill, dosing the 
inquisitive fish with her tiny, parasitic babies. The larvae are drawn in by water currents to the 
fish’s gills, where they attach. An attached larva stimulates the tissue of the fish to produce a 
small cyst in which it will be protected and nourished. The mantle of the baby mussel contains 
cells that break down the tissue of the fish and digest it, providing sustenance for the glochidia 
for 10-30 days, at which time it breaks out of the cyst and sinks to the bottom to begin its 
sedentary way of life. All of this will probably be a long way from where they were originally 
released by their mother. This parasitic hitchhiking ensures that a very sedentary species can 
spread, thus exploiting new areas of habitat. 



226 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ There are approximately 30,000 species of bivalves. They are very well represented 
in fossil deposits, and in some places their fossilized shells can be found in huge 
numbers. They have been around for at least 500 million years, and today, they are 
still a successful group of animals. Their bodies have become modified for a sedentary 
existence. Most species will spend their entire adult lives in the place where they 
settled as larvae. Some species occur in huge concentrations. Mussels, for example, 
can completely cover huge areas of rocky shore, 

♦ Lampsilis mussels are native to the United States, and many species can be found 
there. In the United States, these animals have an abundance of interesting common 
names, including pink mucket, fat mucket, and Higgins’ eye. The United States has a 
rich fauna of freshwater mussels, with some 300 species, 

♦ Apart from using a decoy, pocketbook mussels also trick fish in to dispersing their 
offspring in other ways. Some species release their glochidia in colored masses that 
look like tasty worms attached to a gelatinous fishing line. A fish comes along and 
gobbles up these so-called worms, giving the young mussels easy access to its gills. 

♦ The native mussels of the United States are under threat because of the accidental 
introduction of the zebra mussel from the Caspian Sea. The zebra mussel has thrived 
in the Great Lakes and several other waterways in North America. It competes with the 
native mussels for food and space and even attaches to the shells of these bigger species, 

♦ Bivalves are also economically important animals. Many species are valued as food, such 
as mussels and scallops. Some are even regarded as delicacies that command high prices 
(e.g,, the oyster). Pearls and mother-of-pearl are obtained from bivalves. Bivalves have 
also attracted attention from scientists seeking new materials for medical and engineering 
applications. The byssal threads of mussels are incredibly strong and can anchor the 
animal to just about any surface, including wave-battered rocks and the hulls of ships. 

♦ The marine pearl oysters are seeded with small spheres taken from the shells of 
American freshwater mussels. It is reckoned that 95 percent of commercially 
produced pearls have at their center a bead made from an American mussel shell. 
Pearls are a defensive reaction in response to an irritant within the shell of a mollusk. 
Today, they are commercially produced, so a small fragment of shell and mantle tissue 
from another bivalve are implanted near the pearl oyster’s gonads. Over three to 

four years, or occasionally six, the oyster deposits layer after layer of mother-of-pearl 
around the irritant, forming a pearl, which is eventually harvested.

ing with curiosity at the photographer. (Stephanie

hyena are distinctive, as the front pair is longer than those at the rear, giving the animal a 
sloping back when standing. The muzzle of the spotted hyena is pronounced. The coat of 
the animal is light brown and shaggy, with a short mane. The tail is relatively short with a 
brush of long black hairs. As the name implies, dark brown oval spots dapple the coat. 
Where does it live? The spotted hyena is found practically everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, 
except South Africa and the Congo basin. 

Is It a Girl or Is It a Boy? 

The spotted hyena is a beautifully adapted predator and scavenger of the African continent 
living in so-called clans containing up to 80 individuals occupying territories of 10-65 sq, km. 
The group structure in these clans is complex because, unlike other social, carnivorous mam- 
mals, females are the dominant sex. The adult females in a clan are dominant to all the males, 
and they assume the normal male role in clan protection and territorial disputes. Not only are 
the females aggressive, but the sex-role reversal is even apparent in their appearance, as the 
female genitalia are astonishingly malelike to the extent that it is very difficult to tell the differ- 
ence between a male and female. Should you ever be in the position to look between the rear 
legs of a female spotted hyena, you will see a perfectly formed false scrotum and false penis. The 
pseudopenis is actually a hugely modified clitoris, which is erectile just like a real penis. The 
pseudoscrotum is formed from the exterior skin of the female genitals. This massive modifica- 
tion means the female spotted hyena must urinate, mate, and give birth through the conduit of 
her elaborate clitoris. 

The last of these acts presents a great deal of difficulty as the aperture at the end of the clitoris 
is small and the young are the largest of any carnivore (in relation to the size of the mother). 
Giving birth to a baby through the clitoris is a long and probably very painful process. Not 
only is the birth canal small, but it is also oddly orientated due to the internal anatomy. In a 
female hyena giving birth for the first time, the false penis may tear as much as 15 cm along its 
length to accommodate the passage of the baby. Should the young survive the birthing process, 
they are active almost immediately and have teeth that are put to good use on their siblings, 
which are attacked as soon as they emerge from the clitoris. The fur around a young hyenas 
neck is often damp with saliva following an attempted throttling from one of its siblings. These 
attacks are rarely fatal; it is just a way of establishing a system of dominance in the litter. 



228 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Hyenas are interesting for a number of reasons, not least due to the peculiarities of 
the female spotted hyena’s external genitals. The general appearance of the hyena 
suggests a close evolutionary link to the dog family; however, hyenas are an offshoot 
from the cat branch of the carnivores and are more closely related to cats than dogs, 

♦ Today, there are four extant species of hyena: spotted, brown, striped, and the 
aardwolf. The prehistoric hyenas were very large, and the cave hyenas were at least 
twice as large as the biggest spotted hyena. 

♦ Anatomically, the spotted hyena is adapted for a scavenging way of life, feeding on 
the scraps left by other carnivores. The jaws, in particular, are very robust and are 
equipped with interesting teeth. The premolars are large and adapted for crushing 
bones, whereas the carnassial teeth are perfectly suited for slicing and shearing. The 
bite of the spotted hyena is hugely powerful and, relative to its size, is probably the 
most powerful bite of the carnivorous mammals. The strength of the spotted hyena’s 
bite enables it to splinter and break the bones of carcasses. Not only can it break 
bones, but it can also swallow and digest them. The stomach acid of the hyena is so 
powerful that it can digest even large bone fragments. The hyena will not only eat 
bones, but horns, hooves, ligaments, and hair, much of which is regurgitated later as a 
pellet. Due to the high proportion of bone in the diet, the feces of the hyena are white 
and crumbly. 

♦ Hyenas are very efficient predators, A group of 38 hyenas has been observed to 
consume an adult zebra in 15 minutes, leaving little in the way of scraps. The voracity 
of the hyena can also be its undoing as sharp fragments of bone and other material 
will be swallowed, which can sometimes prove difficult to digest even in the harshly 
acidic environment of the animal’s stomach. 

♦ Although excellent scavengers, spotted hyenas are also first-rate opportunistic 
hunters. Individual hyenas have been observed pursuing an adult wildebeest for 5 km 
at speeds of up to 60 km/h. Once the prey is captured, the spotted hyenas have no 
problem dispatching it.

odd position, are the eyes. The rear legs are long and powerful and have broadly webbed 
feet. Fully grown specimens may attain a length of 20 cm, although 10.5-17 cm is more 
typical. The long, thin digits on the forelimbs end in small, starlike structures. Color varies, 
but they are generally grey brown to black with diffuse mottling. 

Where does it live? This is an animal of the Amazon region of South America, It can be found 
in Peru, Guyana, Surinam, Brazil, and islands such as Trinidad. They prefer muddy, slow 
moving, or still water with plenty of vegetation in which to hide. 

Youngsters that Get Under Your Skin 

The Surinam toad is far from being a handsome creature. On appearance alone, the observer 
would be forgiven for thinking that this amphibian abomination is nothing short of an evolu- 
tionary accident. However, dig a little deeper, and you will find this odd little animal is fasci- 
nating for a number of reasons, not least of which is the way in which it reproduces and looks 
after its young. During the breeding season, in the sluggish and still waters of this toad’s home, 
males begin calling to attract a mate. Unlike many other toads, they are unable to croak or emit 
any of the sounds we associate with these animals; they lack the vocal cords and vocal sacs. 
Instead, they are able to produce sharp, clicking sounds by snapping the hyoid bones in their 
throat. These clicks travel far and rapidly in the dense medium of water, and females will appear, 
investigating the sounds. Exactly what a female Surinam toad looks for in a mate is unknown, 
but if she finds one that she likes the look or sound of, she allows mating to proceed. The male 
grips his larger partner by her waist and clings on for dear life as he is carried through the water 
in a series of daredevil loop-the-loops. On the up part of these somersaults, when the female is 
above the male she releases, a few eggs. These fall on to the male’s belly and as the pair continue 
their loop, the eggs fall off the male and onto the female’s back, undergoing fertilization as they 
move through the sperm ejected by the male. With the fertilized eggs now on the female’s back, 
her partner hugs her tighter and presses them into the thick, spongy skin. In preparation for the 



230 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


breeding season, the skin on her back has been getting progressively thicker and softer. After 
several of these somersaults, the pair stays locked together for as long as 12 hours. This long 
bout of amplexus keeps the eggs in place until a degree of skin swelling holds them firmly to give 
an effect like small yellow balls embedded in plasticine. Eventually, the pair part company, and 
the female wanders off with many growing young lodged in the skin of her back. 

Steadily, the skin around the eggs continues to swell, until after about 10 days, when each 
egg is sealed in its own little chamber. At this stage, the back of the female looks like a section 
of honeycomb, with numerous small cells, each containing a developing toadlet. In the safety of 
their own private nursery, the young develop rapidly, nourished by the yolk contained within 
their egg, and after 12-20 weeks in a scene reminiscent of gory science-fiction films, numerous 
tiny toadlets break out from the brood chambers. When they hatch, they are fully formed min- 
iature toads. The safety of the pockets on their mothers back saw them through their tadpole 
and transitional stages. Surinam toadlets are like their parents in every respect, even down to the 
carnivorous tendencies of the adults. The young will quite happily snatch at any living thing big 
enough to fit in their capacious mouths, including their brethren. 

♦ The Surinam toads and their relatives, the African clawed frogs, number 
approximately 30 species. The former are found throughout tropical South America, 
while the latter are native to sub-Saharan Africa, The body of these amphibians is very 
well suited to an aquatic existence, and they rarely leave the water, only doing so to 
locate a new home if space is scarce. They are also unusual in that they have no tongue, 

♦ One of these amphibians, the African clawed toad ( Xenopus laevis), is the laboratory 
animal of choice for molecular biologists and geneticists everywhere. Development 
is quick, and they are easy to maintain in captivity, making them a firm favorite for 
experimentalists. Research on this animal has paved the way for a huge number of 
medical and scientific breakthroughs, one of which was the birth control pill. 

♦ Adult Surinam toads are out and out carnivores. They sit motionless on the bed of 
their muddy pools or rivers for hours, blending in unerringly to the submerged carpet 
of dead leaves. When the opportunity arises, they strike with explosive speed, gulping 
the unfortunate victim into their voluminous maw. 

♦ The unusual breeding behavior of the Surinam toad underlines the diversity of 
reproductive strategies employed by the frogs and toads. From a basic -body-plan 
point of view, the frogs and toads are all very similar; however, over millions of 
years, they have evolved a huge number of ways to ensure the maximum survival of 
their young. We have already seen how tiny tropical frogs nurse their young in small 
arboreal pools of rainwater. Others whip up a frothy nest for their young from the 
female’s genital secretions. Back breeders also nurture their young in cavities on the 
female’s back, with the added advantage of nourishment supplied by a placenta-like 
arrangement. In mouthbreeders, the young develop in the male’s vocal sacs, in some 
cases emerging about 50 days later as fully developed froglets. There is, it seems, no 
limit to the ways in which the amazing amphibians ensure the survival of the next 
generation.

cilians nibble at the nutritious skin of their 
mother. (Mike Shanahan) 


Taita Hills Caecilian — This photograph of a cap- 
tive caecilian shows just how odd these amphibians 
look. (Alexander Kupfer) 



Scientific name: Boulengerula taitanus 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Amphibia 
Order: Gymnophiona 
Family: Caeciliidae 

What does it look like? This is a long and thin animal, and superficially it resembles an 

earthworm. Adults are 20-33 cm in length, and along the length of the steel blue body are 
small encircling grooves, which give the animal a segmented appearance. The head and tail 
are bullet shaped. The eyes of this amphibian are much reduced and are concealed beneath 
bone and skin. A pair of small sensory tentacles can be projected from the head. 

Where does it live? This species is only known from the Taita hills and their immediate 
vicinity in southeastern Kenya, It is a fossorial animal, and spends almost all of its time 
underground. The caecilians are widespread in soils of forests and agricultural landscapes. 


Many Mouths to Feed 

Caecilians make excellent parents. They invest a great deal of time and energy in their young 
to ensure they have the best start in life. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Taita hills 
caecilian of Kenya, It has been known for a long time that the female would lay her eggs in a sub- 
terranean lair and jealously guard them until they hatched by coiling her sinuous body around 
them. It was also known that the fetuses of this species had well-developed teeth. The presence 
of these teeth in such young animals puzzled scientists, and the full significance of them has only 
recently been discovered. It turns out the complete nurturing behavior of this animal is a lot 
more complicated and interesting than originally assumed. 

The young caecilians stay with their mother for around two months after they hatch. Only 
mammals usually show this level of maternal care, and it was unclear exactly what the young 
were doing for such a long period of time. Caecilians do not have mammary glands and teats 
like mammals; therefore, extending periods of breast feeding are out of the question. The slen- 
der, pink young probably survive on yolk stores for their first few days of life, but scientists 



232 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


videotaping captive litters noticed some odd behavior. The young could be seen nuzzling and 
butting their mother’s body and it was eventually found that they were peeling off the outer- 
most layers of her skin and eating it. When females of this species are brooding, their skin be- 
comes pale and thickens considerably until it is twice as deep as that of a nonbrooding female. 
The skin cells change from the normal flat, dead variety to succulent parcels filled with proteins 
and fats. To enable the young to peel away this nutritious skin they are born with a number of 
small, hooklike teeth. On this nutritious diet of maternal skin, the offspring thrive, and every 
week their body length increases by 11 percent. After two months of feeding in this way, the 
young have grown sufficiently to enable them to leave their mother and go their own way. 

♦ Around 170 species of caecilians have so far been identified, but due to their very 
secretive ways and rarely visited habitats, it is very likely that many more species are still 
to be discovered. They range in size from 10 to 150 cm. They are all found in the tropics, 

♦ The caecilians first appear in the fossil record more than 150 million years ago. They 
have become so well adapted to a subterranean existence that they have lost many of 
the typical outward characteristics of the amphibians. 

♦ Of all the land-living vertebrates, only the birds have no truly subterranean 
representatives. The amphibians have the caecilians, the reptiles have the 
worm-lizards and snakes, and the mammals have the moles and a multitude of 
other burrowing forms. An underground life promises abundant food and relative 
safety from surface predators, but it requires major changes to the animal’s body. In 
amphibians and reptiles, these changes have led to animals that look strikingly similar. 

♦ One of the unique features of the caecilians is the pair of small tentacles found 
between the eyes and nostrils. These can be projected and withdrawn and depend on 
many muscles and other features typically associated with the vertebrate eye. Their 
exact function is unknown, but it is thought they gather small samples of air for the 
taste organs in the roof of the mouth. In snakes this is achieved by the flicking tongue, 

♦ Most caecilians are terrestrial burrowers, excavating tunnels by using their rigid, 
compact head as a battering ram. Some species will venture to the surface during the 
night or if their tunnels are flooded by heavy rains. 

♦ Some of the caecilians in the family Typhlonectidae are aquatic as well as being the 
largest of these limbless amphibians. The Typhlonectidae are only found in South 
America and lack the little tentacle that all other caecilians have. The aquatic species 
have a fleshy fin extending along the rear section of their body enabling them to swim 
through the water in the same way as an eel. 

♦ All caecilians are carnivorous. They have an under-slung jaw, enabling them to subdue 
and eat suitably sized prey encountered in their tunnels. Worms will often be taken, 
as will other soft-bodied invertebrates of the soil and leaf litter. 

♦ Other than skin feeding, the caecilians show a range of reproductive oddities. Many 
species give birth to live young, and the fetuses of some species are nourished inside 
the female on uterine milk and the thick lining of the uterus. The fetuses have 
elaborate gills. In the terrestrial species, these are very long and branching, extending 
from just behind the head of the baby amphibian. In the aquatic species, these gills 
look like small, leaf-shaped sacs. In the adults of all but one species, the job of gas 
exchange is taken over by lungs.

Tarantula Hawks — An adult female tarantula hawk 
who will soon begin her search for a tarantula to feed

Ecology and Evolution, Estable Institute, Uruguay) 


Scientific name: Pepsis species 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Insecta 
Order: Hymenoptera 
Family: Pompilidae 

What do they look like? These are very impressive looking insects. They can be large, with 
some species having a body length of 8 cm and a wingspan of 10 cm. They are handsomely 
colored, typically being a metallic blue or black with brightly colored wings. They have the 
typical wasp body plan: a head with large eyes and antennae, a bulbous thorax that bears the 
long legs and also contains the powerful flight muscles, a thin waist, and a tapering abdomen. 

Where do they live? These insects have a worldwide distribution, with species being found 
in India, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, and the Americas, They are often associated with 
arid habitats but are also found in areas with lush vegetation. 


A Mother Not to Be Messed With 

Tarantulas are the stuff of nightmares. Their appearance alone is enough to make the flesh crawl. 
Imagine, then, going into the confines of a tarantula’s lair, a narrow, silk-lined burrow. This is 
exactly what a type of female wasp, known as a tarantula hawk, must do to continue the species. 
The female tarantula hawk will pick up the scent of a tarantula and trace it back to its source. 
Occasionally, the spider will be in the open, hunting, but the odor may just as easily be emanat- 
ing from the burrow of the spider. 

In the small number of tarantula hawk species that have been studied, the female wasp is very 
specific about which species of tarantula she requires, and to confirm this, she needs to get as 



234 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


close as possible to the spider. Should the 
wasp have found the correct species of prey, 
something odd happens, the exact cause of 
which is not fully understood, but the spi- 
der becomes quite docile and very rarely 
attacks the female wasp. Perhaps the wasp 
produces a pheromone, which stupefies 
the spider. The wasp now crawls around 
and over the spider, vibrating its antennae 
furiously, a behavior which is thought to 
confirm to the wasp that she has the cor- 
rect species of tarantula. Once sure, the 
wasp delivers the coup de grace and uses her 
formidable sting to inject potent neurotoxic 
venom through the thin membrane that 
joins the base segment of the leg to the body. 
Though the venom is not fatal to the spider, 
it does cause paralysis. The spider can then 
be dragged by the wasp to the bottom of its 
burrow, and once there, she lays a single egg 
on the arachnids abdomen. She then seals the spider and her egg in the burrow. Eventually, the 
egg hatches and the larva thrusts its mouthparts into the abdomen of the paralyzed spider and 
begins to feed on the animal’s juices. The larva grows rapidly, but in completing its development, 
it switches to a diet of solids, so it feeds on the spider’s organs, leaving the essentials, and the spi- 
der survives and does not rot. With pupation imminent, the larva consumes the essential organs 
as well, killing the long-suffering spider before weaving a silken cocoon in which to pupate. With 
metamorphosis complete, the adult wasp chews itself clear of the cocoon and exits the burrow to 
search for a mate and begin the process all over again. 

♦ The Pompilidae, the wasp family containing the tarantula hawks, is composed of 
approximately 5,000 species, and like any invertebrate group, there are probably 
many more species yet to be identified. Commonly, they are known as spider wasps 
as the larva develop, typically, on a spider provisioned by the female. Although 
widely distributed, the Pompilidae are predominantly a tropical and temperate 
wasp family. 

♦ Experiments conducted with several species of tarantula hawks have demonstrated 
their very exacting prey preference, A female of one of these species placed in a cage 
with the wrong species of tarantula will take no interest in the spider, and it may in 
fact be killed by the large arachnid. 

♦ Some of the pompilids, known as pirate pompilids, have dispensed with finding their 
own spider and instead wait for another species to do it for them. In one group, the 
pirate pompilid will open the sealed nest and lay an egg of its own, which will hatch 
to feed on the original egg/larva and the paralyzed spider. In another group, the fe- 
male of the pirate species will lie in wait for an unsuspecting female of another species 
of pompilid, dragging its prey to the nest before rushing out and quickly laying its 
own egg in the book lung of the paralyzed spider. After the prey has been buried by 


^ Go Look! 

The smaller spider-hunting wasps can be found in a num- 
ber of habitats, particularly those that are dry and warm. 
Look out for medium-sized wasps with black bodies and 
red markings. They are typically seen scurrying along the 
ground, with characteristic nervous twitching of their 
wings, applying their antennae to the ground searching 
for odor clues, which may belie the presence of a suit- 
able spider. If you watch them for long enough, you may 
see them find a spider, and a fight will normally break 
out as the wasp attempts to sting its prey. The venom 
is fast acting and the wasp will then drag and carry the 
paralyzed spider back to its brood burrow. Should you 
be lucky enough to find a spider that carries an egg or 
larva of a pompilid, you can take it home and keep it in 
a small container where you can watch it develop. Ecto- 
parasitoids, like the pompilid larva are very easy to rear. 
They already have their food, so all they need is a small, 
relatively humid cage. 




THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 235 


the original hunter, the pirate’s egg hatches first, and the larva immediately searches 
out and consumes the original hunter’s egg before consuming the spider. 

♦ The tarantula hawks are reputed to have one of the most painful stings of any insect. 
The Schmidt Sting Pain Index was devised by an entomologist after being stung by 
most stinging Hymenoptera. The tarantula hawks are second in this scale, with a 
sting said to be excruciatingly painful. Although painful, the sting of the tarantula 
hawk is not as dangerous as the sting of the honeybee, which can cause anaphylactic 
shock in hypersensitive people. The painful sting of the tarantula hawk is an effective 
defense against vertebrate predators.

TRANSVESTITE ROVE BEETLE

Scientific classification:

Class: Insecta 
Order: Coleoptera 
Family: Staphylinidae 




236 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


What does it look like? The beautiful transvestite rove beetle has a covering of short hairs, 
giving it a furry appearance. It is between 18 and 25 mm in length, and the head carries a 
large pair of eyes and enormous sickle-shaped mandibles. Like all rove beetles, the wing 
cases are short and do not cover the abdomen. The abdomen is often upturned in this 
species. 

Where does it live? Found in central and northern South America in forested areas. It is often 
seen on forest tracks or perching on low vegetation and is usually found near freshwater. 

Looking Feminine to Find a Mate 

In terms of appearance, the males of this species are divided into two types. There are the big, 
bullying so-called normal males, who are large and powerful, and then there are the sneaky 
males, the transvestites, who mimic the appearance of the females and are therefore considerably 
smaller than the normal males. Both types of males defend territories centered on a resource 
that will attract females, such as a small pile of dung. Dung is important to these beetles as they 
depend on it to lure their favorite food — flies. The big males attempt to defend these territories 
by repelling the attentions of other males who are looking for a dung pile of their own. Putting 
their appearance to good use, the transvestite males can get the girl if dung resources are thin on 
the ground. A big male guarding a good pile of dung will attract lots of females, and this is just 
what the transvestite male needs. He looks and probably smells like a female and can therefore 
scamper undetected amongst the normal male’s harem and, more importantly, sneakily mate 
with the females under the nose of the normal male. Sometimes the illusion is a little too good, 
and the smaller male has to bow to the amorous attentions of the big male or run the risk of 
being exposed as a fake and attacked. His disguise is so complete that instead of begrudgingly 
giving in to the larger male, he actively encourages the larger male to copulate by presenting the 
tip of his abdomen. 

Duplicity is a way of life to these beetles. Not only do they lie about their gender, but they 
also use a cunning trick to dupe their prey. Normally, the beetles will congregate around some 
feces, the corpse of an animal, or rotting fruit and wait for flies to descend, attracted by the scent 
of decay. When the fly is busy feeding, the beetle will pounce and dispatch the victim with its 
lethal mandibles. Sometimes, however, the beetle will adopt a quite different strategy, a strategy 
that has no need of rotting matter. The beetle sits on a leaf, stone, or similarly exposed spot, 
often near a stream, and with its abdomen pointing upward, everts a pair of glands. The beetle 
will even rub the tip of its abdomen on the surface where it stands. Small flies find the odor and 
secretion from these glands very alluring. They are fixated by this smell and will not fly away 
even if the beetle accidentally brushes against them. They will edge ever close to the beetle to find 
the source of the odor, until they are within range of the beetle’s jaws, 

♦ Sneak copulations are common in animals where males guard a resource (i.e., food 
or nesting sites) that attracts females. In many mammal species, there are individual 
males who dominate mating. The other, lowly males in the group will also want to 
mate, but will have to do so covertly, without the dominant male catching them. 

♦ Rove beetle species in all parts of the world are attracted to decaying matter because 
of the other animals that are drawn to it. Rove beetles associated with dung are 
normally ambush predators, but they will also stalk their quarry over short distances. 
The mandibles of these species are always large and sickle-shaped, but they are useless 



THE CONTINUATION OF THE SPECIES 237 


for breaking down food, so, like 
many predatory beetles, they 
regurgitate digestive juices onto 
their prey, turning it into a liquid 
mush that can be sucked up. 

♦ In the tropics and subtropics, 
dung and other rotting mat- 
ter does not last long before it 
is broken down by a range of 
animals, bacteria, and fungi. As 
soon as it appears in the habitat, 
it will be colonized and utilized, 
representing for a short time, a 
very rich habitat for scavengers 
and their predators. The clever 
strategy of using an odor to 
attract small flies is important 
when their main resource is not 
available. 

♦ As with the Stenus rove beetle, 
the substance produced by the 
anal glands of the transvestite 
rove beetle was probably origi- 
nally a deterrent to predators, 
but over time, it has evolved to 
fulfill another function. It is not 
yet known what odor it is mim- 
icking to attract the flies. 


^ Go Look! 

Animal excrement, particularly the large amounts pro- 
duced by grazing animals, such as cattle and horses, is 
used by a myriad of insect life. If you see a field of horses 
or cattle in the summertime, go and take a look at these 
hotbeds of insect activity. Many of the insects attracted 
to this resource are fast moving and flighty; therefore, 
approach with stealth. There will be flies on the surface 
of the matter, feeding, mating, and laying eggs, and at its 
edges, there may be rove beetles waiting to pounce on the 
flies. If the feces are a few days old, scarabid beetles will 
have arrived and will be burrowing through it to make 
their dung-stocked nests in the soil below. Underneath a 
cowpat there will be lots of animal life. There will be fly 
and beetle larvae and animals that specialize in feeding 
on these, such as small rove beetles and histerid beetles, 
which are normally very shiny and black and can retract 
their head, legs, and antennae into grooves on their body. 
Mites are also very common in dung, and often the ani- 
mals that live on it or in it have a few mite passengers 
sticking to their undersides. Today, it is common practice 
for farmers to feed their cattle and horses drugs called 
ivermectins (avermectins), which kill worms living in the 
gut of the animal. These chemicals are not only toxic to 
parasitic worms, but they also end up in the animals 
dung where they kill the many insects that depend on 
this resource. This has huge repercussions for the popu- 
lations of birds, bats, and small mammals that feed on 
the dung insects.

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Percifomes 
Family: Nototheniidae 

What does it look like? A fully grown Antarctic toothfish may be as much as 140 kg in weight 
and 2 m long, although the average size is considerably less. They have a long, cigar-shaped 



240 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


body with a broad head bearing big rubbery lips and large eyes. Long fins run along the back 
and the underside, and behind the gills are the large fanlike pectoral fins. Their skin has 
quite a somber color and ranges from grey to black or olive brown. The underside is typi- 
cally paler. 

Where does it live? This fish lives in the deep, cold waters around Antarctica, It is often caught 
in the Ross Sea and has been hooked at depths of more than 2,000 m. 

Cool but Not Freezing 

The frigid waters of the Southern Ocean are home to a surprising diversity of animals. The water 
is rich in nutrients, supporting huge densities of plankton. This plankton is munched by bigger 
planktonic organisms, which are in turn caught and eaten by small fish. Bigger fish eat these 
small fish, and so the food chain goes until you get to the top predators. In these cold waters, 
fully grown toothfish, cruising through the chilly waters, sculling their pectoral fins, are amongst 
the top predators. They cruise through the cold, dark waters on the look out for suitable prey. To 
enable them to live in these waters, the toothfish have some remarkable adaptations. The waters 
in the Southern Ocean are on the cusp of freezing, and any animal that swims through them 
must be suitably protected against the cold. Freezing is fatal to most animals as the tiny ice crys- 
tals that form in their tissues will rupture cells, killing the animals. Put a lettuce or a strawberry 
in the freezer for a while to get an idea of how damaging ice crystals can be to cells. 

The blood of the toothfish contains some substances to counteract the lethal effects of ice 
crystal formation. As the temperature drops toward -2°C (the temperature at which seawater 
freezes), water molecules will begin latching together firmly, forming tiny ice crystals that 
coalesce into the ice we are so familiar with. Circulating in the blood of the Antarctic ice are 
lots of large molecules called antifreeze proteins. These proteins are very strongly attracted 
to the surface of an ice crystal, and when they bump into a tiny sliver of ice, they stick fast to 
its surface. With this molecule on its surface, the ice crystal can’t grow any further. Without 
these tiny antifreeze molecules, the blood and the tissues of the Antarctic toothfish would 
quickly freeze, and the animal would die if it ingested some ice or if an ice crystal penetrated 
a wound. Not only is the toothfish equipped with antifreeze, but it also has other adaptations 
to enable it to thrive in the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. As a direct result of the 
chilly conditions, the fish has a very slow metabolic rate. Its heart beats about once every six 
seconds, which is astonishingly slow for such a large animal. With its blood coursing with 
antifreeze and its metabolism barely ticking over, the toothfish is hardly a hyperactive fish. 
To snaffle prey, it can use a short but powerful burst of speed, but generally it skulks in open 
water, mostly near the bottom without expending too much energy. Its skeleton is composed 
mostly of cartilage, making it lightweight, and around its body are various pockets of fatty 
tissue. Both of these adaptations contribute to the fish’s ability to remain neutrally buoyant 
in deep water without expending muscular effort. Although there is very little light at the 
depths at which this fish lives, its eyes are very sensitive to even the faintest scattering of light 
from above, enabling it pick out the ghostly shadows of other fish in the gloomy depths. The 
Antarctic toothfish is an excellent example of how animal life can thrive in even the most in- 
hospitable of conditions. 

♦ The Antarctic toothfish belongs to a family of fishes known as the cod icefishes. Al- 
though they can resemble cod, they are a completely different type of fish. Worldwide 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 241 


there are around 50 species of cod icefish. They are mostly found in the Southern 
Ocean and around the coast of Antarctica, 

♦ The larger species of cod icefish, such as the toothfishes, are among the dominant 
predators in the cold waters of the far south. They are thought to fulfill the same eco- 
logical role as sharks do in more balmy waters, 

♦ The antifreeze proteins in the blood and tissues of these fish are very important in 
their ability to tolerate cold conditions, but it is also thought the spleen plays a crucial 
role. It has been suggested that the spleen removes the tiny, thwarted ice crystals from 
the circulating blood. 

♦ As they have a very slow pace of life, the toothfish can reach a considerable age. Large 
specimens may be at least 50 years old and are probably far older. 

♦ In recent years, stocks of other types of fish have dwindled, forcing commercial fishing 
boats to cast their nets farther afield. The fishing fleets have turned their attention to 
the waters around the Antarctic, the home of the toothfish. The Antarctic toothfish, 
and to a greater extent the Patagonian toothfish, are finding themselves the targets 

of intensive fishing efforts. The flesh of these fish is good to eat, comparable to the 
northern true cod, and large numbers of them are being hauled from the depths every 
year. A single high-quality specimen, good enough for sushi, can be sold for as much 
$1,000. One of the largest fisheries operates from South Georgia, and it is allowed a 
catch of 3,000 tonnes per year. There is scant information on the populations of these 
remarkable fish, but it is known that they take a long time to mature and can reach 
grand old ages. Any fish with these characteristics will be very vulnerable to the effects 
of overfishing, and populations may take decades or longer to recover from overex- 
ploitation.

BEARD WORMS 

Scientific name: Siboglinids 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Annelida 
Class: Polychaeta 
Order: Sabellida 
Family: Siboglinidae 

What do they look like? The beard worm can be a large animal, as much as 2.5 m long and 
4 cm wide. Its long body is divided into a frontal crown bearing a spray of tentacles. This 
fore-part is attached to a long trunk containing most of the animal’s organs. Attached to the 
trunk is a segmented, knoblike structure that anchors the worm in its tube home. Remark- 
ably, the adult worms have no sign of a mouth, gut, or anus. 

Where do they live? The beard worms are found throughout the world’s oceans. They are 
often encountered on continental slopes and areas of seafloor that are spreading due to the 



242 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Beard Worms — A cutaway of a beard worm

presence of a rift in the earths crust. All of the large beard worms are found at depths ex- 
ceeding 100 m, in the ooze of the seafloor. 

Gas Guzzlers 

Between 1977 and 1979, discoveries were made in the deep Pacific Ocean off the Galapagos 
Islands that revolutionized our understanding of some of the most fundamental biological prin- 
ciples. Before this time, it was thought that the sun was the ultimate source of energy for all 
living things. Plants, algae, and an abundance of smaller life -forms use the power of the suns 
rays to produce organic molecules via the process of photosynthesis. These organisms are the 
producers, and they are the foundation of all life on Earth, or so it was thought. Over 2,600 m 
down in the Pacific, it is pitch black. The life-giving energy transmitted in the rays of the sun is 
all absorbed by 125 m, yet in these dark places, dense communities of animals thrive, dominated 
by the beard worms, which are found in dense aggregations of more than 200 per square meter.

How are these animals living and thriving at such great depths without the power of the sun? 
It took several years to learn the secret of these worms, but eventually the puzzle was pieced 
together, and the result is astonishing. 

These deep-water worms are all found around what are known as hydrothermal vents, essen- 
tially underwater geysers that belch out warm water and huge quantities of gases such as hydro- 
gen sulfide. The worms, most of their body safely in the confines of a tube, bathe their splendid 
crown of red tentacles in this noxious, heated water. The tentacles are red because blood con- 
taining hemoglobin is pumped through them, absorbing oxygen and sulfide-containing chemicals 
from the water. The hemoglobin molecules carry their cargo to a special part of the worm called 
the trophosome. In an adult worm, a large part of the trunk is taken up by the dense, brown tissue 
of this organ. The trophosome is not an organ in the normal sense. It is actually a part of the body 
that is dedicated to a symbiotic relationship with huge numbers of bacteria. These bacteria absorb 
the gases dissolved in the worm’s blood and convert them into organic molecules, some of which 
are secreted and used as nourishment by the worm. This amazing symbiotic relationship allows 
the beard worms to generate their own nutrients from the chemical energy contained in the warm 
water of the deep-sea vents, in closed ecosystems far from the life giving rays of the sun. 

♦ There are approximately 120 species of beard worm, and because they dwell at such 
great depths, it very likely that there are many more species yet to identified. The first 
specimens were dredged from the seabed in 1900 off the coast of Indonesia. As the 
worms are rather fragile and easily broken by dredging, it was not until the 1960s that 
scientists got a look at a complete specimen. 

♦ There are two types of beard worm, perviate and obturate. The perviate beard worms 
are much smaller than their relatives, measuring between 5 and 85 cm, and hardly 
ever more than 1 cm in diameter. The perviate beard worms have a knot of tentacles 
at their head end, instead of a tentacular crown. These threadlike tentacles are used to 
absorb oxygen and sulfide-containing chemicals from the water, but it is thought that 
the nourishment provided by the symbiotic bacteria is supplemented by the absorp- 
tion of edible particles in the seabed detritus. 

♦ The beard worms are the only group of animals where all the representative species 
completely lack a mouth, gut, and anus. These features are important in understand- 
ing the relationships of different groups of animals; therefore, for many years, it was 
difficult to know what the beard worms were related to. In 1988, it was found that 
the larvae of beard worms possessed a complete gut, which bore a resemblance to that 
of juvenile annelid worms. So, it seems the beard worms are related to the annelid 
worms, but their paths probably diverged over 500 million years ago, as fossils of 
beard-worm-like animals have been found in North American, north European, and 
Greenlandic Cambrian rocks, 

♦ The beard worms construct tubes made from chitin, the same material that makes an 
insect’s exoskeleton. They secrete this tube on the seabed, among shells or on decaying 
wood. 

♦ The trophosome of the beard worms is very tightly packed with symbiotic bacteria. 
One gram of the tissue from this organ can contain 1 billion bacteria. It is still not 
clear how a young beard worm strikes up a relationship with bacteria. It is thought 
that when the worm is very small, a tiny vent on its body allows marine bacteria to 



244 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


enter and set up residence, eventually giving rise to the trophosome. Although the 
worms primarily rely on the secretions of their bacteria for sustenance, it is also pos- 
sible that their helpful passengers are digested now and again. 

♦ The bacteria living inside the worm are chemosynthetic. Unlike photosynthetic organ- 
isms (trees, alga, etc,), they can produce living matter from chemical energy instead of 
solar energy. 

♦ Every symbiosis is a two-way relationship. It may appear that the worms are taking 
advantage of the industrious bacteria, absorbing the extra nutrients they produce 
without any anything in return. In fact, the bacteria are provided with a safe place to 
live and reproduce. It is also possible that the full extent of their symbiotic relation- 
ship is yet to be understood. 

♦ The fact that these animals dwell in places far from the limits of normal, sun- 
dependent life is made even more remarkable by the fact that they lay down bulk 
by using hydrogen sulfide gas, which is toxic to all other forms of life. The unique 
makeup of their blood allows them to transport oxygen and this normally toxic 
gas through their tissues without any ill effects. 

COCONUT CRAB 

Scientific name; Birgus latro 
Scientific classification; 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Malacostraca 
Order: Decapoda 
Family: Coenobitidae 

What does it look like? The coconut crab is a very large crustacean. Reports of the full size this 
animal can reach vary wildly, but a body length of at least 40 cm and a weight of 4 kg are 
realistic. The first pair of legs is very well developed, and they bear huge pincers. The second, 
third, and fourth pairs of legs are slimmer and used for walking, while the last pair are very 
small and thin. The body is divided into two major parts, the carapace (cephalothorax) and 
the abdomen. All parts of the body have a very tough exoskeleton. Color also varies greatly, 
but these crabs are normally blue or brownish with pale patterning. 

Where does it live? The coconut crab is found in a large swathe of the Indo-Pacific region, 
stretching from the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean to the Pitcairn and Easter Islands 
in the Pacific, It prefers coastal habitat, but has been found up to 6 km from the ocean. In 
some areas they live in rocky crevices, while in others they construct burrows in sandy ground. 

Life on Land Is a Tough Nut to Crack 

The crabs, regardless of their success in the world’s oceans, never really made much of an impact 
on dry land. However, one exception to this is the coconut crab. As an adult, this animal is so 
adapted to a terrestrial way of life that if it is submerged in water for any length of time, it will 
drown. Not only have they turned their back on a marine way of life, but they have also devel- 
oped into by far the largest land-dwelling invertebrate. Although the normally accepted limit is 
around 4 kg and 4 cm in length, there are reports of specimens more than double this length and 
four times the weight. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 245 



Coconut Crab — A coconut crab has used its sensitive sense of smell to sniff 
out a dead fish. (Mike Shanahan) 


These gigantic crabs start life as eggs attached to the underside of their mother, who must 
venture down to the shore to release her brood into the water. The larvae that hatch from these 
eggs are marine and spend the first month or so of their lives floating around in the plankton. 
After this aquatic phase, the young, which have managed to survive the rigors of an aquatic exist- 
ence, drop to the seabed where they seek the empty shells of marine snails. The young crab backs 
into a suitably sized shell and uses it as a mobile home, disappearing into it at the first sign of 
danger. The crabs soft abdomen is particularly vulnerable, so it is concealed in the empty shell at 
all times. During this time, the young coconut crab may leave the water occasionally to explore 
dry land. This amphibious stage lasts another month, during which time the crab may have 
changed its shell to accommodate its growing body. With dry land beckoning, the crab leaves 
the sea forever, but it will be another two or three years before it can ditch its protective shell. 
Its ability to survive in water is lost, but its modified gills enable it to breathe air. These gills 
are situated in the carapace of the crab and are surrounded by a spongy tissue, which must be 
kept moist at all times to ensure sufficient gas exchange. This is where the frail, rear legs come in 
handy as they are dipped into water and brushed against the gill tissue. 



246 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


With these lungs, the coconut crab can explore its terrestrial habitat. They haul themselves 
over the sandy ground of their islands and can even scale coconut palms. They may take to a 
palm to get out of the sun or to evade a predator. It is doubtful that they actually cut develop- 
ing coconuts from their stalks, but they can use their fearsome pincers to open coconuts that 
have already fallen. Anyone who has tried to open a coconut will know this is no mean feat, 
but the crab’s pincers are strong enough to lift a weight of 29 kg, and with patience the crab 
can whittle down the tough covering of these huge seeds. Although tough nuts can be dealt 
with by the crab, it eats a wide variety of other fruits and decaying animal matter. Small ani- 
mals, like newly hatched turtles, which are too slow to escape the crab’s clutches, are also on 
the menu. 

All this food leads to increased bulk, and the only way the coconut crab can grow is by shed- 
ding its skin. In a fully grown specimen, this is an elaborate process, which takes place in its lair 
over a period of 30 days. The new skin is soft and flexible, and the burgeoning bulk quickly takes 
up the slack. Not wanting to be wasteful, the crab eats its shed skin after it has recovered from 
the considerable exertions of changing its armor, 

♦ The coconut crab is a type of hermit crab, of which there is 500 known species. All 
spend at least part of their life in the discarded shells of marine snails. 

♦ Mating in the coconut crab is a brusque affair and involves the larger male wrestling 
the female onto her back where he precedes to copulate. Shortly after, the female 
produces her fertilized eggs and adheres them to her abdomen where she keeps them 
until they are ready to hatch. 

♦ The coconut crab is also known as the robber crab, as it apparently fond of stealing 
pots and pans from houses and tents. It may mistake these objects for food and will 
drag them back to its burrow, which is what it does with real food. Competition for 
food can be fierce; therefore, tasty morsels are normally taken back to the animal’s lair 
before being consumed. 

♦ During the larval stage, the vast majority of coconut crabs will fall foul of predators, 
but an adult specimen has nothing to fear except humans. The flesh of this animal 
is a delicacy in many areas, and so hunting pressure can be quite intense. Fortu- 
nately, in several areas the crab is protected, or collecting is limited to sustainable 
levels. 

♦ With the present conditions on Earth, the size of the coconut crab is probably the 
greatest that can be attained by a terrestrial invertebrate. It has been proposed that 
the concentration of oxygen was far higher in the atmosphere many millions of years 
ago. This allowed many types of invertebrate to reach gigantic proportions.

COELACANTH 



Coelacanth — A coelacanth uses its flexible fins to steady itself on the rocky sea bottom. (Mike 
Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Latimeria chalumnae 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Sarcopterygii 
Order: Coelacanthiformes 
Family: Latimeriidae 

What does it look like? Coelacanths can grow to be more than 2 m in length and 80 kg in 
weight. They are a steely blue gray color and are dappled with irregular white spots. Their 
eyes have an ethereal golden reflection due to a layer of tissue in their retina. 

Where does it live? These fish have been found around the Comoros Islands, Sulawesi 
(Indonesia), Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, and the Greater St. Lucia 
Wetland Park in South Africa. All of Comoros Island coelacanths have been captured on 
long lines in 260-300 m of water, about 1.5 km offshore. 

If It’s Not Broke, Why Fix It? 

Countless times throughout Earth’s history, cataclysmic events, the likes of which we can only 
make educated guesses at, have wiped out much of the planets life. Yet some animals survived 
these dark times and spawned lineages that have persisted into the present, more or less un- 
changed. A perfect example of an animal representing a lineage that has scarcely changed in 
millions of years was discovered in 1938, when Courtney Latimer, a curator of the museum 
of East London (South Africa), was in the Comoros islands looking for interesting specimens 
among the catch of the local fishermen. Amid a pile of fish, she spied an unusual, steel blue fin. 



248 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


She exposed the owner of this fin and found it to be a species of fish she had never seen before. 
Convinced it was something special, she bought it from the fishermen and took it with her. In 
1930s Africa, refrigeration was rare indeed, so to preserve the fish, she took it to her local taxi- 
dermist who promptly stuffed and mounted it. Unsure of what she had found, she contacted 
James Smith of Rhodes University in South Africa who was intrigued by the possibility of a 
discovery of a species new to science. Smith was not to be disappointed. He visited Latimer and 
her stuffed fish and was bowled over by what he saw. There in front of him was a coelacanth, a bit 
dog-eared, but a coelacanth nonetheless. The coelacanths were known only from ancient fossils 
and were thought to have become extinct at least 70 million years before Latimer’s discovery. 
The observant curator had inadvertently discovered what would become the most famous so- 
called living-fossil of all time. When Smith announced the discovery, the scientific community 
was in disbelief, and many thought the living fossil was an imaginative hoax. A fresh specimen 
was needed to prove to the naysayers that the coelacanth was a surviving relic of a bygone age, 
A bounty of £100 was offered to anyone who could present a coelacanth. In those days, £100 
was a large sum of money, so the search began in earnest. It was 14 long years until another 
specimen was captured. This proved beyond any reasonable doubt that a descendent of a fish 
from the mists of time had survived the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period and 
was alive and well and living in the Indian Ocean, almost indiscernible from long dead animals 
only known from fossils. Since 1952, more than 150 specimens of this fish have been caught in 
the waters around the Comoros Islands. 

It was not until the late 1980s that living coelacanths were filmed in their natural environ- 
ment. Hans Fricke along with some of his colleagues used a submersible to descend into the 
waters where coelacanths had been caught. Their expedition was a great success, and they saw 
at depths of almost 200 m, six coelacanths going about their everyday business. All were seen in 
the middle of the night on or near the seabed, and all moved their fins in the same way as a four 
legged animal moves its legs. 

Another chapter in the saga of the coelacanth began in 1997, when a British couple on their 
honeymoon in Indonesia spotted what looked like a brown coelacanth being brought into the 
market. The fish was collected, and it was indeed a coelacanth, but it was a different species from 
the one found around the Comoros Islands. This species was dubbed Latimeria menadoensis. 
To the locals, this fish was known as rajah laut (king of the sea). In 2000, three deep-water divers 
in the St. Lucia marine park off South Africa unexpectedly spotted a coelacanth while at a 
depth of 104 m. Further searches revealed the coelacanth, a relic from a long ago, was thriving 
in many areas, 

♦ The coelacanth is so important to zoology because it represents a group of animals 
from which all land-living vertebrates evolved. All the amphibians, the reptiles, and 
the abundance of mammals and birds evolved from an ancestor very similar to this 
fish. The fins of these fish are what developed into legs, enabling large animals to carry 
their weight on dry land. 

♦ The coelacanths and their relatives first appeared about 380 million years ago, or so 
the fossil record suggests. They were numerous and diverse up until the Cretaceous, 
but whatever cataclysmic event occurred at the end of this era spelled the end of these 
animals, or so it was thought. The ancestors of the modern day coelacanth obviously 
managed to hang on during these torrid times. Their deep-water habitat and ability to 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 249 


scavenge would have given them an edge, but it is likely they too teetered on the brink 
of extinction. 

♦ Apart from being an ancient relic, the coelacanth is peculiar for a number of reasons. 
The locals in the Comoros Islands had known about the coelacanth for many years 
before Courtney Latimer discovered it. Once hooked on a line, they make powerful 
and aggressive opponents and will struggle for a long time before being reeled in. The 
local name for it was gombessa, which translates as “worthless.” The tissue of the coe- 
lacanth exudes oils even when dead, making its flesh taste foul. Salting it can make it 
semiedible, but it is far from coveted by the Comoros fishermen. 

♦ Live coelacanths swim slowly near the seabed with languid strokes of their fleshy fins. 
Their body is held at an angle with the head pointing toward the bottom. Sometimes 
they flip over and swim upside down, A gold reflective layer in the coelacanths retina 
enables it to see in the dim world of the deep sea, 

♦ Female coelacanths give birth to live young. One captured specimen was dissected to 
reveal five young, all of which were about 30 cm long. It is a mystery how they mate, 
as the males have no special structure to introduce sperm into the female. 

♦ There is a great deal still to learn about these ancient fish. The fact that they were 
unknown to the world of science before 1938 shows how little is known about the 
oceans in general.

GIANT MUDSKIPPER 

Scientific name: Periophthalmodon scblosseri 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Actinopterygii 
Order: Perciformes 
Family: Gobiidae 

What does it look like? This fish looks a lot like a gargantuan tadpole with flippers. It is one of 
the biggest mudskippers, reaching lengths of almost 30 cm. Its long body is speckled brown 
with a broad black stripe running from the eye all the way to the tail. The pectoral fins are 
well developed, and the gill covers are large, giving it a rather fat-cheeked look. The first 
spine of the dorsal fin is large and can be erected to hoist up the fin. The mudskippers eyes 
are large, goggling, and positioned on top of its head. 

Where does it live? The giant mudskipper is native to Southeast Asia and can be found from 
Indonesia to Borneo, They are typically found in mudflat-type habitats, which represent the 
boundary between land and sea, 

A Fish Out of Water 

Think of a fish, and your mind’s eye automatically conjures up an animal beneath the waves, 

perfectly adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Yet, in some parts of the world where the sea is calm, 

some fish have left their watery world for a moist life on the margins of the land. These fish 



250 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Giant Mudskipper — A giant mudskipper hauls out on the exposed root of a mangrove tree. (Mike 
Shanahan) 


are the mudskippers, and the giant mudskipper is one of the largest species. In the sheltered 
lagoons and bays of the Indo-Pacific, silt, sand, and organic matter is deposited by rivers or by 
the sea itself to form large mudflats. These habitats are very rich in animal life, and in burrows 
within the mud dwell the giant mudskippers. Although the giant mudskipper spends most of 
its time with its body hauled out of the sea on its powerful pectoral fins, it has not completely 
turned its back on the water. Unlike true terrestrial vertebrates, the mudskipper does not have 
lungs. Instead it must obtain its oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide by using its gills and 
so-called skin breathing. The membranes in its mouth and throat are packed with blood ves- 
sels enabling gas exchange to take place as long as they are kept moist. Unlike other fish, the 
gill filaments of mudskippers are short and sturdy and do not collapse in on themselves when 
removed from the support of the water. These too, need to be kept moist to work effectively, so 
the gill chambers are actually quite large, allowing a small reservoir of water to bathe the gills. A 
rudimentary respiratory system is one thing, but how does a fish with fins move around when 
it is on land? Fins are perfectly adapted to propelling an animal through the dense medium of 
water, but on land, they are essentially useless. Evolution has equipped the mudskipper with 
modified fins that have a sort of elbow joint. These fins support the body of the fish and enable 
it to move forward in a series of short hops, or skips. The fins cannot be moved alternately to 
allow the animal to walk; nonetheless, the fish makes rapid, albeit ungainly, progress across the 
mud. When skipping just isn’t fast enough, the fish can flip its muscular body and catapult itself 
up to 60 cm into the air. 

Although the giant mudskipper is at home on land, it will take to the water where it can still 
swim well. The large, protruding eyes are all that can be seen of the fish when it is in the water. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 251 


When it skips from the water, the big eyes must be periodically moistened and so are retracted 
into the sockets. By sucking in its eyes now and again, the fish also swirls the water in its gill 
reservoirs, further improving gas exchange. All in all, the giant mudskipper is a very successful 
animal on the cusp of an amphibious existence. It gives us a fascinating, modern-day take on 
how backboned animals took their first tentative steps, or skips, on land. 

♦ Worldwide there are around 35 species of mudskipper, most of which are found 
around the coasts of the Pacific and Indian oceans, A few species are found around 
Africa; yet none are known from the New World. 

♦ Most mudskippers are carnivorous animals — catching and eating a wide range of 
prey, although there are some species that graze on algae. 

♦ The giant mudskipper builds a nest in the mud using its mouth. In this hole, the 
mudskipper can seek refuge from the tropical midday sun and predators. The mouth 
of the burrow is surrounded by a low wall of mud, which traps a small pool of water 
around the entrance when the tide recedes. The burrows can sometimes be very elab- 
orate, reaching a depth of more than 1 m and with many entrances, 

♦ It is in these burrows that the mudskipper lay its eggs. Although there is water 
in the burrow, it is very low in oxygen, so the proud parents bring mouthfuls of 
air into the burrow to aerate the water. The eggs are actually laid on the roof of a 
chamber at the bottom of the burrow, and the larvae that hatch stay in the safety 
of this refuge until they transform into miniature mudskippers. They then swim 
out of the burrow and loiter in the small pool of water that surrounds the burrow 
entrance, 

♦ Mudskippers are very territorial animals. They defend small areas of mud around 
their burrows and behave very aggressively toward trespassers, especially around 
breeding time. They gesture to one another by erecting their dorsal fins, and if these 
visible warnings are insufficient, they will chase each other. These chases may end in 
the pair joining battle where they wrestle with their mouths. 

♦ The erectable fins in many species are brightly colored, and the male uses these 
to impress females. He flips into the air and flashes his dorsal fin at the peak of 
the jump. 

♦ The mudskippers view of the world is an unusual composite: half color and half black 
and white. The retina has color sensitive rods in the top half and monochrome cones 
in the lower half. The significance of this is not yet understood. 

♦ There are even mudskippers that can climb trees. Using their powerful fins, they edge 
themselves along the exposed roots and lower branches of mangrove trees. The fins 
not only propel them but also provide a certain degree of suction, giving the fish a 
good grip during these arboreal explorations.

252 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


GIANT SQUID 




Giant Squid — A giant squid has large eyes and a 
mass of tentacles to hunt other animals in the ocean 
depths. (Mike Shanahan) 


Giant Squid — A giant squid recovered from a trawl 
net. The long feeding tentacles have broken off, but 
the scale bar shows the size of this creature. (Gene 
Carl Feldman) 


Scientific name: Architeuthis dux 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Mollusca 
Class: Cephalopoda 
Order: Teuthida 
Family: Architeuthidae 

What does it look like? The squid is a peculiar-looking creature. At the head end, there are 
eight muscular arms and two long tentacles, all of which bear suckers. At the center of the 
rosette of tentacles is the mouth with its powerful jaws, which bear a remarkable similarity 
to the beak of a giant parrot. Behind the tentacles is the head with a large pair of eyes, and 
further back still is the mantle — the housing for the animal’s organs. The mantle is hydro- 
dynamically tapered, sporting a pair of fins for steerage. 

Where does it live? The deep, uncharted oceans are the habitat of the giant squid. It is known 
from deep water in the South and North Atlantic Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean, Its 
specific habitat requirements are poorly understood. 


Calamari as Big as Car Tires 

The support provided by water allows the animals to attain great size. The giant squid is a per- 
fect example of this as it is an invertebrate; yet when we think of animals without backbones 
we normally think of worms, insects, and the like. Imagine, then, a giant squid washed up on a 
Newfoundland beach in 1878 with a body length of almost 17 m. Of course, most of this length 
was due to the tentacles, but the animal still tipped the scales at 2,200 kg, millions of times big- 
ger than a typical invertebrate. 

Not only are giant squid large, but they are also active hunters, which whip their tentacles 
around with great speed when attempting to seize prey. Suction cups, surmounted by a rim 
of horny toothed chitin are found on the underside of the squid’s arms and on a palm-like 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 253 


pad at the end of the tentacles. These cups, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm, are mounted on a 
stumpy stalk and latch onto the prey, bringing it toward the gnashing beak where the shorter 
arms maneuver it. The beak can tear the prey into pieces before it is taken into the mouth by 
the rasping radula, a structure common to all mollusks, which functions like a scraping tongue. 
The few giant squid that have been found show that this animal feeds on fish, other squid, and 
octopuses, and it was thought for a long time that they were little more than scavengers, eating 
whatever food they came across. However, recent footage from a Japanese vessel in the Pacific 
Ocean showed a giant squid taking bait from the end of a 900 m line. The sequence of pictures 
shows the squid is a fast-moving predator, using its numerous limbs to explore the bait before 
lunging at it. The animal in the pictures was in such a rush to take the bait that it got itself 
snagged on the line and struggled for four hours before eventually freeing itself by losing a 5 m 
section of tentacle. 

Although the giant squid is one of the biggest invertebrates and an effective predator, it is 
not invulnerable. The sperm whale appears to a specialist predator of this massive mollusk. The 
big rectangular head of the sperm whale is often covered with scars made by the suction cups of 
struggling squid. Some of these scars are so large that it points to the possibility of some mon- 
strous squid, as yet undiscovered, stalking the ocean depths. 

Clearly, sperm whales relish giant squid, and it would be reasonable to assume you could 
make the mantle of the giant squid into massive rings of delicious calamari. Unfortunately, you 
would be very much mistaken. Giant squid calamari would taste disgusting, at least to us. In the 
tissues of the squid there are high levels of ammonium chloride, a substance that acts like a buoy- 
ancy aid but imparts the flesh with a foul taste to which the sperm whale must be oblivious, 

♦ Cephalopods are represented by approximately 600 living species, but as with any 
ocean creature, it is more than likely that many more species are yet to be discovered. 
As a group they first appear in fossil record during the Cambrian period, around 500 
million years ago, 

♦ The giant squid is probably the inspiration for the legends of sea monsters, such as 
the Norwegian kraken, the Caribbean lusca, and the Mediterranean Scylla. Rarely 
seen sea creatures were often made out to be terrible monsters, responsible for the 
disappearances of ships and their crews. The giant squid is just a fascinating animal 
and represents no danger to humans whatsoever. 

♦ The eye of the giant squid is one of the largest in the animal kingdom, with a diam- 
eter of at least 25 cm. Not only are the eyes of the creature big, but they are sensitive 
enough to allow the brain to form images comparable to those of higher mammals, 
such as humans. In some ways, the eyes of squid and octopuses are superior to those 
found in vertebrates. The light-collecting cells in the cephalopod eye face the incom- 
ing light instead of facing away from it (the vertebrate eye). Also, the cephalopod eye 
does not have a blind spot like that of the vertebrates, Cephalopods probably cannot 
see in color, but they can probably discern small differences in tone, 

♦ The giant squid has a very interesting way of mating. The male has a long, prehensile 
tube at least 90 cm long, loaded with small packets of sperm. This tube is used like a 
hypodermic syringe, and when the male encounters a female, he injects the females arms 
with his sperm parcels. As giant squid live in the blackness of the ocean depths, no one 
has seen the prelude leading up to what appears to be a brutal means of reproduction. 



254 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ The giant squid, like all squid and octopuses, uses a form of jet propulsion to move 
short distances. Water in the body cavity can be shot out from a short, mobile siphon 
near the animal’s head by powerful contractions of the mantle muscles. As the siphon 
is mobile, the squid can squirt itself forward just as well as backward with surprising 
speed. This is a very inefficient way of swimming, so the larger species normally use 
their fins and arms when cruising. 

♦ In 1925, another species of squid, now termed the colossal squid, was identified from 
fragments of two tentacles found in a sperm whale’s stomach. Recent findings sug- 
gest this species is even larger than the giant squid. It is a heavy-bodied animal, with 
bigger eyes and a bigger beak than the giant squid. Its tentacle clubs brandish some 
impressive, swiveling hooks that are used to catch prey. It is found in the Southern 
Ocean, especially around Antarctica and is probably another favorite snack of the 
sperm whale.

HAGFISH 

Scientific name: Mxyine species and others 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Myxini 
Order: Myxiniformes 
Family: Myxinidae 

What do they look like? Hagfish are elongate, wormlike animals ranging in length from 18 to 
116 cm. The skin is smooth without scales and can be pinkish, grey, or black. They lack eyes 
and have sensory barbels around the mouth. They have no fins, but the tail is flattened from 
side to side. 

Where do they live? Hagfish are found around the world, in cold temperate waters. They are 
found on or near the sea bottom, down to depths of 1000 m and probably more, and will 
often makes burrows in the muddy ooze of the seabed. 

It’s Not All about Looks 

The first time someone sees a hagfish, the typical reaction is abject disgust. Although these are 
not the most attractive animals, hagfish are nonetheless very interesting. They are scavengers, and 
they swim slowly, sniffing for the odor of death and decay in the water, which may indicate the 
presence of a dead or dying fish nearby. As the hagfish has no jaws, it cannot bite chunks from 
the carcasses it finds. Instead, it fixes two pairs of horny rasps carried on a tongue-like structure 
to the carcass and then ties a knot in its very flexible body. The knot is forced down toward the 
head end of the animal, and when it reaches the carcass, it provides leverage to the rasping appa- 
ratus, which is retracted, pinching some of the flesh from the carcass. This technique is excellent 
when the carcass in question is small; however, occasionally the hagfish may chance upon the 
bounteous feast of a whale carcass. In this situation, the hagfish will be joined by huge numbers

Hagfish — A hagfish ties itself in a knot to tear some flesh 
from a fish. (Mike Shanahan) 


of its kin that search for an easy way into the dead animal. Of course, the most obvious route 
into the body is through a natural aperture, such as the anus, eyes, ears, or blowhole. Once inside 
the carcass they can devour the soft organs. 

The rasps of the hagfish can also be used to catch marine invertebrates, such as polychaete 
worms, which appear to make up the bulk of its diet. Although the hagfish is a very efficient 
scavenger and predator of small animals, its metabolic rate is very slow, so it can go for as much 
as seven months without feeding. 

Not only is the hagfish’s feeding strategy rather peculiar, but the way in which it defends 
itself is even more extraordinary. Along the flanks of the hagfish are a line of slime glands, which 
during periods of danger or inactivity pump out huge quantities of gelatinous slime. The slime 
is used to deter potential predators, heal wounds, and produce a lining for the burrows in which 
these animals sometimes seek refuge. Slime production is so prolific that a single hagfish can turn 
a whole bucket of seawater to slime in a little over 30 minutes. So much slime is produced that 
the animal will often block its single nostril and have to essentially sneeze to clear the passage of 
the thick mucus. 



256 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ There are 64 known species of hagfish in 5 genera ( Eptatretus , Myxine, Nemamyxine, 
Neomyxine, and Notomyxine). Although they are thought to represent an ancient line- 
age, fossil evidence supporting this theory was lacking, until recently. A single fossil 
discovered at the end of the 1980s shows an animal so strikingly similar to today’s 
hagfish that it seems they have not really changed for at least 300 million years. This is 
remarkable but is testimony to how well these animals are suited to their environment. 

♦ Unlike the vast majority of other chordates, the hagfish lacks a cerebrum, cerebel- 
lum, jaws, and stomach. Instead of one heart, the hagfish has a systemic heart, plus 
three accessory hearts. The skeleton of the hagfish is composed of cartilage and not 
bone. The digestive tract of the hagfish is unusual because a lump of food is enclosed 
in a permeable matrix, and the only other animals known to produce this peritrophic 
membrane are insects. Also, unlike other fish, hagfish do not have a larval stage but de- 
velop directly into miniature adults. The eggs of the hagfish are also very large, approx- 
imately 2.5 cm long, and only small numbers are produced. But although the fecundity 
of the hagfish is not high, they are often found at very high densities — up to 15,000 in 
a very small area. This suggests that the hagfish have very low levels of mortality, but 
then again, what animal would be stupid enough to eat one of these slimy creatures? 

♦ The slime produced by the hagfish is a complex and interesting substance. When it 
emerges from the slime glands, it absorbs water, swelling enormously. Unlike the slime 
produced by other animals, hagfish slime contains numerous threadlike fibers, which 
probably give it mechanical strength. The slime produced by hagfish is currently being 
studied for its potential in medical applications. One interesting application is in the 
promotion of wound healing, as it has been observed that hagfish wounds heal very 
quickly and cleanly, 

♦ For many years, hagfish were of no commercial importance, but relatively recently a 
thriving hagfish fishery has developed. In Korea, the flesh of these animals is eaten, 
and the skin is made into a fine leather called eelskin. The Oregon fishery for the 
Pacific hagfish began in 1988 and peaked in 1992, with 15 vessels catching over 
330 tonnes. The fish are caught with either lines baited with dead fish or baited plas- 
tic cylinders. As the reproductive rate of the hagfish is low, overfishing could have 
drastic effects on the populations of these very interesting animals, even though they 
have existed on Earth, unchanged, for many millions of years.

Class: Mammalia 
Order: Primates 
Family: Hominidae 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 257 



Human — Humans have a very large brain and their use of speech and their dextrous hands have 
helped them change the world. (Mike Shanahan) 


What does it look like? Humans vary greatly in size and appearance. In North America, the 
average height of the male is 1.75 m with a weight of around 78 kg. Females are smaller, 
measuring 1.6 m on average and weighing in at 62 kg. Humans walk on their rear limbs, and 
unlike the rest of the primates, their body hair is fine. A human’s eyes are large, and both are 
directed forward to give good binocular vision. 

Where does it live? Humans are probably native to the continent of Africa, but in a geologi- 
cally short period of time, they have spread to all parts of the world. The only environments 
where humans have not established communities are the harshest ones, such as high moun- 
tain tops, the sea, the driest deserts, and the polar regions. 

We Have Come a Long Way 

Some people may disagree with the inclusion of humans in this book. They might argue that we 
aren’t animals. Let me assure you that from a zoological point of view, we are simply a type of 
primate, albeit a very intelligent one. In a geologically short period of time, the human species has 
spread over the globe and has become the most successful animal the world has known — a true 
survivor. Other animal species are constrained by the environment and have evolved adaptations 
to cope with what their environment throws at them, but the human species is equipped with 
three unique tools — the brain, the hands, and language — and it has used these to turn the tables 
and mould the environment to suit itself. 

The inner workings of our brain are still poorly understood, yet it is the ultimate instrument 
for all of our successes. What the brain thinks up, our voice utters and our hands make real, and 
it is the combination of the three that has made our meteoric rise possible. 

The secret of the human brain is thought to lie in its complexity. In an average human brain 
there are 100 billion separate cells, known as neurons, and each one of these is connected to 



258 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


a multitude of other cells, to the extent that there may be somewhere in the region of a million 
billion neuronal connections. This complexity comes at a price. The brain is very energy hungry 
consuming one-fifth of the whole body’s energy requirements, and the only fuel it can use is glu- 
cose, Such prolific energy consumption in a small space produces huge amounts of heat, which 
must be dissipated if the brain is not to overheat and suffer irreparable damage. 

With the great complexity of this organ comes many complex functions. The brain gives us 
consciousness, complex problem-solving abilities, abstract thought, and many emotions. These 
have led to the evolution of technology, culture, complex societies, and religion. The brain con- 
trols the muscles that moves our limbs and directs the fingers in deft tasks. When you stop to 
consider the achievements of the human race, they are astonishing. We are equipped with a tool 
that allows us to peer into the mysteries of nature. We can grasp abstract concepts that are at 
the very core of the universe and gaze with curiosity at our fellow animals, explaining how and 
why they do certain things. We have invented computers and a multitude of other machines and 
have domesticated countless animals and plants. All of these things essentially come down to the 
brain. Even though this organ makes us what we are, it is still shrouded in mystery. However, it 
is becoming increasingly clear that the secret of its abilities lies in the connections between the 
individual cells. 

Thanks to our origins in the trees, we are equipped with very sensitive hands that make even 
the most delicate manual task possible. The hands instructed by the inventiveness of the brain 
enabled humans to manufacture tools and clothes — the first technologies. The last part of the 
puzzle, speech, allowed us to share ideas and learn from one another. Long before the days of 
writing, speech ensured that ideas and new ways of doing things trickled down from one genera- 
tion to the next, 

♦ There is only one living human species, although three types are identifiable (Euro- 
pean, Asian, and African), all of which have characteristic features — a result of the 
environment where each evolved. 

♦ The origin of humans is a very contentious subject, but most authorities agree that 
modern humans, anatomically identical to you or I, appeared in the fossil record 
in Africa about 130,000 years ago. Scientists studying human evolution by looking 
at DNA from people all over the world have found that there is very little variation 
in our DNA. This means that at some point in its history, the human race was likely 
reduced to a very small population (1,000-10,000 individuals). A huge volcanic erup- 
tion from the Toba caldera in Indonesia has been proposed as the cause of this near 
extinction. As the earth shook off the effects of this massive volcanic upheaval, it has 
been proposed that modern humans began their colonization of the planet, 

♦ For the majority of human history, we existed as hunter gatherers, foraging for meat, 
tubers, and fruits. Then, at least 10,000 years b.c., a massive leap forward was made. 
We learned how to domesticate animals and plants. First to be tamed were the dog 
and bee, followed by several other animals and many plant species. Our forebears 
obviously found the wild relatives of these species useful and bred them to amplify 
the desired characteristics. This single advance was to change the course of human 
evolution. It meant that humans no longer needed to be nomadic. Settlements 
could form, and work could be divided among the individuals in the community. 

With less time being devoted to foraging, more time was available for the learning 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 259 


and sharing of ideas. Later still, these budding settlements in the most fertile areas 
developed into the first cities, 

♦ Although the human species is remarkable beyond doubt, it is exerting an ever- 

greater pressure on the planets resources and other inhabitants. We are already start- 
ing to see the consequences of too many humans consuming the earth’s resources at 
an ever-increasing pace.

LAKE TITICACA FROG 



Lake Titicaca Frog — The wrinkled appearance of the Lake Titicaca frog enables it to survive in the oxy- 
gen deficient waters of its home. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name; Telmatobius culeus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Amphibia 
Order: Anura 
Family: Leptodactylidae 

What does it look like? Adult Lake Titicaca frogs can be up to 50 cm long and 1 kg in weight. 
The head is broad, with large bugeyes. The color varies considerably. Some are olive green 
with a pearl-colored stomach, while others are very dark, almost black, with white under- 
sides. The most distinctive feature is the very loose skin, which hangs in large pleats and 
folds around the animal’s neck, legs, and stomach. 



260 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Where does it live? This frog is found in Lake Titicaca, a huge lake high in the Andes on the 
border between Peru and Bolivia. The frog is found in the shallower parts of the lake, amid 
the reed beds and the other sheltered areas near the shore. 

Wrinkly for a Reason 

Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable lake in the world, and with an area of more than 8,300 sq, km, 
it is also very large. Due to the great altitude at which this lake is found, the oxygen levels in its 
waters are very low, so low in fact that some of the animals living in this lake have evolved some 
remarkable adaptations. Most famous of all the lake’s inhabitants is the Lake Titicaca frog, an 
amphibian that is found only in this lake and only in its shallower reaches. As frogs go, the Lake 
Titicaca variety is quite a specimen. There are reports of adult frogs measuring more than 50 cm 
long, tipping the scales at more than 1 kg. In many respects, the Lake Titicaca frog is much like 
any other frog. It has a squat body, a wide head, and well-developed hind limbs with webbed dig- 
its. What is unusual about this animal is its skin. Its covering is a loose, baggy affair, and around 
the abdomen, legs, stomach, and neck, the flaccid skin falls into folds giving the animal a rather 
unsavory appearance. When it was first discovered by two adventurers during an 1876 expedi- 
tion, it was labeled with the Latin name Telmatobius coleus. This translates as “aquatic scrotum” 
and is a tongue-in-cheek description of its appearance. As unsightly as it may be, the Lake Titi- 
caca frog is perfectly suited to life in the oxygen-deficient waters of the lake. It rarely breathes 
using its lungs but gets most of the oxygen it needs via diffusion across the moist surface of its 
skin. The wrinkling and creasing of its covering greatly increases the surface area available for 
diffusion, allowing the animal to make the very most of the limited quantity of life-giving oxygen 
dissolved in the water. With the oxygen diffusing into its body and the carbon dioxide heading 
out into the water, the frog also requires an efficient means for the transport of these gases. The 
red blood cells tumbling through the amphibians vessels are the smallest of all the amphibians, 
and they contain the most hemoglobin. As these smaller cells with their oxygen gripping hemo- 
globin can be more tightly packed within the veins and arteries, sufficient oxygen can be shunted 
around the body to supply the animal’s demands. 

These physiological adaptations to surviving in Lake Titicaca are impressive, but occasionally 
they are not enough, and the frog has to resort to behavioral means of obtaining more oxy- 
gen. Resting on the bottom in shallow parts of the lake, the frog engages in what can only be 
described as push-ups. These aren’t amphibian aerobics, but the frog’s way of making small water 
currents around its saggy skinned frame. The push-up-powered flow of water increases the rate 
at which oxygen diffuses into the animal’s blood stream and is another ingenious way in which 
these frogs have adapted to the tough environment of Lake Titicaca, 


♦ The Lake Titicaca frog is one of 40 related species, all of which are found in South 
America, 

♦ The Lake Titicaca frog is the largest truly aquatic frog. Its lungs are very much reduced 
and are of little use in gas exchange, although they can be used when the frog surfaces, 

♦ To the native people who live on the shores of the lake and the artificial reed islands, 
the frog has always been a source of wonder. As the frogs often come to the surface 
when it rains, they have generally been revered as rain makers with divine powers. 
During times of drought, an adult frog is captured and placed inside a ceramic pot. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 261 


The pot is taken to a hilltop and abandoned. Its plaintive calls are said to bring rain, 
and if a deluge does arrive, the urn fills with water, releasing the captive amphibian. 

♦ The frog’s large size also makes it an attractive source of protein, and it is a popular 
food in Bolivia and Peru, Recently, a worrying trend has developed involving a drink 
called frog juice. This is a simple, but grisly beverage involving a Lake Titicaca frog 
stripped of its skin, some honey, a local tuber, water, and a blender. Allegedly, the pu- 
reed frog drink is a potent aphrodisiac. The frog is also thought to be something of a 
cure-all. Small ones are swallowed whole to cure a fever, and larger ones are tied to a 
fractured limb to act as living poultice, 

♦ Many relatives of the Lake Titicaca frog are also vulnerable or endangered due to 
overhunting for their supposed aphrodisiac qualities, 

♦ At these lofty altitudes, the ultraviolet shielding provided by the earth’s atmosphere is 
much reduced. The skin on the back of a Lake Titicaca frog is normally dark, which 
provides a certain amount of protection from this potentially damaging radiation. 

♦ Although the frog is a protected species, exploitation has had a drastic effect on its 
numbers. Very large specimens are hardly ever seen today, and what populations 
remain have shrunken considerably. 

♦ Depending on where they are found in Lake Titicaca, the frogs vary tremendously in 
color, leading some scientists to believe that the lake was actually home to several sub- 
species of frog. In actual fact, comparison of DNA has shown all of these color types 
are the same species. 

LUNGFISH 

Scientific name: Dipnoans 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Sarcopterygii 
Order: Ceratodontiformes 

Family: Ceratodontidae, Lepidosirenidae, and Protopteridae 
What do they look like? Lungfish are long, stout-bodied fish that are between 1.5-2 m in 
length. All species have a large, symmetrical tail. The Australian species has the most-well- 
developed fins, but in the other species, these are greatly reduced. 

Where do they live? Found in Australia, South America, and Africa, they are freshwater fish 
that occur in small pools that are prone to bouts of flooding and drying. 

Buried, but Not Dead 

The lungfish are among the most unusual of fish and are remnants of a bygone age. All the living 
species swim with undulating movements of their body through the water of the lakes and pools 
where they live, skulking around on the bed looking for tasty morsels to gulp into their capacious 
mouths. When their pools are filled with water, they will feed ravenously on invertebrates and 
other fish and grow rapidly in preparation for the lean times ahead. Some of the African lungfish 
species inhabit pools that disappear in the dry season as the relentless heat evaporates the water. 
Soon, the pool is reduced to a fraction of its original size, and the fish must seek shelter from the 
worsening conditions. The fish finds refuge in the mud of the pool bed. It excavates a burrow 



262 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Lungfish — A lungfish prepares to see out the worse 
of the dry season in its mucus lined, earthen retreat. 
(Mike Shanahan) 


in the mud, forming itself a large chamber, which can be as much as 1 m underground. In this 
chamber, the fish holds its body in a loose coil with its tail over its eyes and secretes thick mucus, 
which eventually encapsulates its whole body. A small hole in the mucus cocoon links the fish to 
the surface, allowing air to reach the chamber. As their name suggests, lungfish have lungs and 
therefore do not need water to obtain oxygen. Indeed the South American and African lungfish 
will drown if they cannot use their lungs, such is there dependence on oxygen in the air. Deep into 
the dry season, the pool bed may be reduced to an arid, cracked, apparently lifeless habitat; how- 
ever, safe in their chambers, the lungfish are encased in hardened cocoons of mucus, envelopes 
preventing moisture loss from their skin. To survive these dry conditions, the fish must reduce its 
metabolic rate to a bare minimum. In this aestivating state, the fish depends on the muscle bulk 
it developed when it was feeding in the pool. Proteins in the muscles and other parts of the body 
are broken down to supply the fish’s minimal energy requirements. After about six months, the 
rains arrive, replenishing the pool and percolating down to the fish’s lair, dissolving the mucus and 
awakening the fish. Withered and shrunken from its ordeal, the lungfish breaks free of its cham- 
ber, with finding food as its highest priority. Although these animals can remain in the aestivating 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 263 


state for six months, they have been shown to survive four years of entombment. Within one 
month and after some voracious feeding, the fish will have regained its original size, 

♦ There are six living lungfish species. Four of these are found in Africa (African, East 
African, marbled, and slender), and Australia and South America have one species 
each. The African and South American lungfish represent one lungfish group, while 
the Australian species represents a second group. 

♦ Lungfish are living fossils. The remains of similar animals have been found in de- 
posits over 400 million years old. These fossils are the remains of animals that look 
very much like the living Australian lungfish. The fact these fish have lungs is also 
intriguing as it from an animal very similar to the modern Australian lungfish that all 
land-living vertebrates are thought to have evolved. All the amphibians, reptiles, mam- 
mals, and birds evolved from lungfish-type creatures, which took their air breathing 
abilities one step further to spend more time out of the water. The basic body plan of 
the land-living vertebrates can be seen in the Australian lungfish. There are two pairs 
of fins, which correspond to the front and hind limbs of terrestrial vertebrates. The 
Australian lungfish even uses its fins to walk along the bottom of its pool, moving 
them in the same way a walking, land-living vertebrate moves its limbs. 

♦ The global distribution of the lungfish also hints at its great antiquity. Like the velvet 
worm, they are found only in the Southern Hemisphere, and although today they are 
found in widely separated locations, the populations would have been much closer to 
one another before the process of continental drift slowly wrenched the ancient land- 
mass of Gondwanaland apart to form the continents we see today in the Southern 
Hemisphere, 

♦ Only some of the African lungfish species bury themselves in the mud. The Austral- 
ian species resorts to using its lung only when the there is insufficient oxygen in the 
water. Normally this species uses its gills to breathe. Although not all of the African 
and South American species resort to burying themselves, all are dependent on their 
lungs as their gills are very small. 

♦ During the breeding season, the South American lungfish develops a pair of feathery 
appendages, which are highly modified pelvic fins. These fins are used to increase the 
levels of oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from around the eggs in the fish’s nest. 
The pectoral and pelvic fins of the African lungfish are modified into long, tapering 
appendages, the purposes of which are not understood.

MARINE IGUANA 

Scientific name: Amblyrhynchus cristatus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Reptilia 
Order: Squamata 
Family: Iguanidae 



264 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 




Marine Iguana — Adult marine iguanas swim to the sea bed to graze the nutritious seaweed. (Mike 
Shanahan) 

What does it look like? The marine iguana is a large, disheveled looking lizard. Fully grown 
males can be 1.3 m long and weigh as much as 1.5 kg. They are normally black or grey. Color 
can also vary depending on the island on which they are found. In some locations, the adults 
are brick red and black, while in other places they are red and dark green, but mainly during 
the breeding season. The tail is very long, and the limbs are well developed with long, curved 
claws. Along their back, the lizards also have a crest of spines giving them a fierce, dragon- 
like appearance. 

Where does it live? The marine iguana is only found on some of the islands that make up the 
Galapagos archipelago. They are normally found on the rocky coastline but occasionally can 
be seen in areas of marshland and mangrove swamp. 

A Reptilian Beach Bum 

During his expedition aboard the Beagle, Charles Darwin saw and studied many creatures un- 
known to Europeans. The Galapagos were a rich hunting ground for his collecting forays, and 
on the wave -beaten shores of some of the more barren islands, he took note of a peculiar lizard 
basking on the black volcanic rock. In Darwin’s eyes, this lizard — the marine iguana — was far 
from being a looker. The young naturalist described it as a “disgusting, clumsy lizard.” Its fair to 
say the marine iguana is not the prettiest animal, but what it lacks in looks it more than makes 
up for in character. 

Large groups of these lizards bask on the wave lashed shore, their spiky bodies almost blend- 
ing into with rugged volcanic rock. Like all lizards, marine iguanas depend on the sun for their 
warmth. Before they can search for food, they must bask in the sun’s rays until their body tem- 
perature has risen sufficiently. With their muscles nicely warmed, they can set about foraging. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 265 


This is where the similarity to other lizards ends, for this is the only lizard that can live and 
search for food in the sea. Clumsily, they plunge from the rocks into the heavy swell. Once in the 
water, they are graceful animals, and with legs folded along their sides, they use their powerful 
tails to swim through the water. The big males can quite easily dive 15 m to reach the succulent 
algae carpeting the rocky seabed. They cling to the rocks with their sharp claws and graze the 
low -growing seaweed. Although the Galapagos Islands straddle the equator, the water flowing 
around them is cool — the result of upwellings from the ocean depths. It doesn’t take too long 
until the marine iguana starts feeling the chill, and in a state of cold fatigue, it must surface and 
haul itself out onto the rocks. This is no mean feat for a cold-blooded animal. Out on the rocks, 
the iguana returns sluggishly to its territory and sprawls out beneath the warming sun. During 
its subaquatic forays, the iguana swallows quite a lot of salt water with its food, and to prevent 
any ill effects, it must get rid of this excess salt. It does this with the use of special glands, the 
products of which are sneezed from the nostrils. Following a good stint in the sun, the iguana 
may make another foray into the water to get at its favorite seaweed. These daily forages for food 
and long periods of sunbathing are how the marine iguana spends its time. This surely makes it 
one of the most dedicated beach bums in the animal kingdom. 

♦ Iguanas are among the largest lizards and can be found around the world in tropical 
and subtropical habitats. The marine iguana shares the Galapagos Islands with a close 
relative, the Galapagos land iguana. 

♦ The existence of these lizards in the Galapagos archipelago is something of a zoologi- 
cal conundrum. These islands are around 1,000 km from the west coast of Ecuador, 
but since they formed, 5-10 million years ago they have been colonized by various 
animals, most of which have evolved into unique species. How these animals and 
plants reached these remote volcanic islands is a bone of contention. One popular 
theory is that rafts of vegetation torn from river banks by flood waters drifted out 

to sea, eventually finding landfall on the virgin Galapagos Islands. Among the float- 
ing vegetation, and somehow surviving the hardships of a very long and arduous sea 
crossing, there were land animals. Some of these would have been the ancestors of 
the marine iguanas we marvel at today. 

♦ The fact that these lizards are essentially marine demonstrates the power of adapta- 
tion. Their ancestors would have been suited to eating terrestrial plants, but over the 
eons, they gradually developed the ability to take to the sea where they could feast 
on the abundant seaweeds growing in the nutrient-rich waters surrounding these 
islands. 

♦ The unique assemblage of animals and plants inhabiting the Galapagos Islands and 
the way in which they vary subtlety from island to island were major inspirations that 
enabled Charles Darwin to formulate his theory of evolution. 

♦ Today, the Galapagos Islands have been recognized for their ecological importance. 
Most of the land and a vast swathe of surrounding ocean has been designated as a 
national park, world heritage site, and biosphere reserve. The human population of 
the islands continues to expand massively, putting pressure on the flora and fauna, 
especially as nonnative animals have been introduced.

OLM 



Olm — The eyeless olm is adept at hunting prey in of this amphibian, the small limbs, the gills and the 
caves. (Mike Shanahan) complete lack of eyes. (Helmut Presser) 


Scientific names Proteus anguinus 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Chordata 
Class: Lissamphibia 
Order: Caudata 
Family: Proteidae 

What does it look like? A fully grown olm is around 30 cm with a sinuous body and long tail. 
There are two pairs of stumpy legs and three pairs of feathery gills behind the head. In its 
natural environment, the olm is pink with semitranslucent skin. 

Where does it live? The known range of the olm is tiny. It is only found in the Dinaric Alps, 
which form part of the Adriatic coast in Europe, stretching through Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, It inhabits the many elaborate cave systems of 
this region. 

Thriving in the Darkest Corners 

The peaks and crags of the Dinaric Alps provide a mountainous backdrop to the Adriatic Coast, 
Composed of limestone-containing rocks, these mountains have long been at the mercy of the 
elements. Over millions of years, rainwater, with its slightly acidic bite, has eaten into them, 
forming a honeycomb of tunnels and galleries. It is in the perpetually dark, subterranean roots of 
these mountains that you find the olm. Just how long these anomalous amphibians have evolved 
in the dark, chilly waters of these caves is unknown, but they certainly represent one of the more 
ancient groups of salamanders, and over the eons they have become superbly adapted to a trog- 
lodyte existence. 

The body of the olm has been molded by its environment. Its body is long and snakelike, 
enabling it to swim through the water with graceful undulations. The short forelimbs and hind 
limbs of the animal look as though they are in the wrong place. They are so far apart that they are 
of little use for walking. A troglodyte has no need for the skin pigments, such as melanin, which 




PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 267 


protect the delicate, outer covering of an animal from the unforgiving ultraviolet rays emitted by 
the sun. The olm is entirely pink, and beneath the thin skin, the capillaries and the outline of the 
organs can be seen. Where there is no light, there is also no need for eyes, and the olm has almost 
lost these organs completely. The eyes are very small and poorly developed and sit beneath a layer 
of skin. It is only in the fetal olm that the eyes can be clearly seen. 

Food in these subterranean habitats is scarce, and with no light or indeed eyes with which to 
find its prey, the carnivorous olm must slip through the waters of its flooded caves in the hope of 
detecting the water-borne scent of small crustaceans or other invertebrates that make up the bulk 
of its diet. As food is so rarely encountered, the olm is able to go for long periods of time without 
eating a single morsel. The temperature in these caves is cool and constant, allowing the animal’s 
metabolism to tick over at a very slow rate. There is a documented case of a captive olm being kept 
in a container in a refrigerator for 12 years without a single item of food passing its lips. Needless 
to say, this long period of enforced starvation took its toll on the animal. It had lost a lot of weight, 
and to keep itself alive, it had digested some of its own internal organs, including its gut. Even in 
the wild, it is very likely that these animals can go for several years without food. 

♦ The family to which the olm belongs, the Proteidae, is represented by seven species. 
The other species, commonly known as mudpuppies and waterdogs are all found in 
North America, None of these American species are cave dwellers, but they are all 
aquatic and prefer shallow lakes and streams. 

♦ People have known of the olm for centuries, as every so often, floods wash them out 
of their caves into surface streams. Local people called this animal the human fish 
because of its pink skin and limbs, a name that has stuck to this day in its native 
range. Other people, undoubtedly inspired by tales of fabulous beasts, thought olms 
were baby dragons, a belief that persisted for some time. In Slovenia, the animal has 
the name Mocheril. This translates as “the one that burrows into wetness.” 

♦ Even today in the twenty-first century, countless olms have been caught and studied in 
captivity, but very little is known about what they actually do in the wild. For example, 
nothing is really known of their breeding habits in the dark caves of the Dinarics, 

♦ Cave systems, both dry and wet can be found all over the world. Apart from the ani- 
mals normally associated with these habitats, such as bats, there are in fact huge num- 
bers of animals supremely adapted to a life in the darkness. Apart from salamanders, 
there are insects, spiders, crustaceans, and fish. All have lost their eyes, either partially 
or completely; all are very pallid, normally pinkish or white, and many have long, 
sensory appendages with which to find their prey in the dark. Day length and other 
rhythms only have a limited effect on true troglodyte animals, as deep down in a cave 
system, the conditions are pretty much constant through the year, 

♦ Sealed cave systems are discovered by explorers on a regular basis. In some cases, 
these underground time capsules have been sealed for thousands, perhaps millions 
of years. The animals within evolve in isolation and are occasionally found to be de- 
scendents of primitive creatures only previously known from fossils. Recently, a sealed 
cave system in Romania was found to contain at least 30 species of organisms new to 
science. Like some deep-sea ecosystems never touched by the suns rays, the founda- 
tion of life in these sealed caves is the gases dissolved in hot water springs. Bacteria 
thrive on these gases, providing a source of food for other more complex organisms.

SPERM WHALE 




Sperm Whale — A sperm whale dives to catch other marine animals, with giant squid being a particular 
favorite, (Mike Shanahan) 

Scientific names Physeter macrocephalus 
Scientific classifications 
Phylums Chordata 
Class: Mammalia 
Order: Cetacea 
Family: Physerteridae 

What does it look like? The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales. Males (bulls) 
can be as long as 20 m and weigh 70 tonnes. Females are much smaller. The whale has a 
huge block head, small pectoral fins, a large triangular tail fluke and a long, narrow lower- 
jaw studded with large conical teeth. 

Where does it live? Sperm whales are found throughout the world’s oceans and in the Medi- 
terranean Sea, Populations are most dense in regions above underwater continental shelves 
and canyons. 

Plumbing the Depths 

The head of the sperm whale is immense, accounting for 40 percent of its total body length. If 
this capacious space was filled with brain, the sperm whale would have more grey matter than it 
knew what to do with, alas, the rectangular head is filled mostly with wax. This wax is whitish 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 269 


and rather gloopy, giving the whale its common name as whalers in the eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries likened it to semen. 

Why should this animal have a head brimming with wax? The blunt answer is that no one is 
really sure. There are several theories. One of these relates to the whale’s feeding behavior. The 
favored prey of the sperm whale are those animals that dwell on or near the seabed, such as 
squid, fish, and small sharks. To reach these tasty morsels, the whale must dive to great depths, 
making it the deepest-diving animal on the planet. It is not known exactly how deep they can 
dive, but it is at least 1,200 m and possibly as much as 3,200 m (about 10 times the height of the 
Eiffel tower). These dives can last for two hours. The whales don’t have an aqualung; however, 
their muscles can store a lot of oxygen, enabling them to stay underwater for long periods. Even 
so, swimming down to the seabed would quickly drain their oxygen stores, so it is has been pro- 
posed that the wax aids them in their search for food. 

The wax organ in the head, the spermaceti organ, has a series of passages and chambers and 
a blood supply. When the sperm whale is ready to dive, some scientists have suggested that sea- 
water is allowed into these passages, circulating around the wax and cooling it. Cooling results in 
shrinkage, and the wax increases in density, surpassing that of the surrounding seawater. With 
a heavy head, the whale sinks to the bottom at a rate of around 170 m per minute. Once at the 
bottom, the whale can begin to feed. After a good forage, hunting for nameless creatures in inky 
blackness, the whale’s oxygen stores begin to run low. The whale must return to the surface or 
drown. It has been theorized that blood flow is increased to the wax organ, and as it warms, it ex- 
pands, becoming lighter and acting like a buoyancy aid to carry the exhausted whale back to the 
surface. Once at the surface, the animal rests for approximately five minutes before diving again. 
After several long dives, the whale is thoroughly spent and has to float around on the surface for 
many minutes. 

The buoyancy aid theory is an interesting one, but it has also been suggested the spermaceti 
organ helps the whale catch its prey in the pitch dark of the ocean depths. It is possible they just 
reach the seabed and scoop up the bottom mud and anything edible. Tin cans and stones in the 
stomach of captured whales support this notion, but more interesting is the fact that, like bats, 
sperm whales can echolocate, using sound to build up a picture of their environment. Echolocation 
may be used not only to find their prey but also as a weapon. It is thought the sound pulses pro- 
duced by the whale are focused by the wax in the spermaceti organ, in much the same way as a glass 
lens focuses light. The focused bursts of sound produce pressure waves in the water that stun prey. 

The large wax-filled head of the whale may also be important during the breeding season. 
Some scientists think the head full of wax acts as a shock absorber to prevent damage to the deli- 
cate parts of the head when the animals ram into each other during disputes, or even into ships 
when defending themselves. In the whaling days, three whaling ships are known to have been 
sunk after being rammed by large sperm whales. This may explain the wax, but the female also 
has a wax-filled head, and fighting is normally the pastime of male mammals. Also, some other 
species of cetaceans have wax in their heads, such as the bottlenosed whales. They are not known 
to ram into one another, but they do dive to great depths to capture squid, supporting the theory 
that the wax is somehow involved in feeding. 

♦ The sperm whale holds other records in the animal kingdom. In addition to being the 
deepest diving animal, it also has the largest brain, weighing in at 9 kg. In comparison, 
a human brain weighs 1-1.5 kg. It is also thought to be the largest toothed animal 



270 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


that has ever lived. There is evidence of giant bulls killed in the early days of whaling, 
which were probably 28 m long and 150 tonnes in weight. If these accolades weren’t 
enough, the sperm whale also has the thickest skin of any animal — more than 30 cm! 

♦ The title role of Herman Melville’s classic, Moby Dick, was a gigantic white sperm 
whale. 

♦ This species was once the favored target for whalers, as the whales rest at the surface 
for a long time, completely exhausted after finishing a sequence of long dives and are 
therefore essentially defenseless. The whalers used hand harpoons and later ship- 
mounted ones to kill the whales, before dragging them back to the ship. Its social be- 
havior also made it attractive to whalers. Pods of this cetacean consist of females and 
young males (adult males are solitary), and if one member of the family is injured, the 
whales will rally around and support the injured animal (the marguerite formation) 
to prevent it from drowning. This behavior made it easy for whalers to kill many indi- 
viduals quickly, as other group members would soon surround an injured animal. 

♦ Once dead, the whales were not only processed for their meat and blubber, but also 
for the spermaceti wax in the head, which was used as a high quality lubricant. Up 
until recently it was used as a lubricant in some very high-tech applications, such as 
the space industry, where synthetic alternatives could not match its specific qualities. 
Another substance, found in the intestine of the sperm whale, ambergris, is also highly 
prized. It is thought this substance, also known as so-called floating gold binds hard, 
indigestible bits of food so they can be safely passed from the whale’s digestive system. 
Fresh ambergris is black and sticky and is far from sweet smelling. Once passed by 
the whale it can drift for many years, all the time being weathered by the sun and salt 
water. Eventually, when it gets washed up, its smell has become a lot more alluring. It 
is this weathered ambergris that is prized by purveyors of fine fragrances, command- 
ing prices of $20 per gram. A 15 kg lump recently found washed up in southern Aus- 
tralia would be worth $295,000, which is a good reason to take up beachcombing. 

♦ The sperm whale was hunted ruthlessly in the 1850s to the point where the popula- 
tion collapsed in 1860. The population recovered, and in the 1960s, when factory 
ships scoured the oceans vacuuming up the large whales, at least 25,000 sperm whales 
were killed every year. The peak was in the 1963-64 season when 29,300 animals 
were taken. This scale of exploitation is not sustainable, and the commercial hunting 
of these whales is banned; fortunately only Norway, Japan, and some indigenous peo- 
ples are allowed to catch a small quota.

SUN SPIDERS 

Scientific name: Solifugids 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Solifugae 
Family: many 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 271 



What do they look like? The sun spiders are medium to large arachnids. The largest species 
can have a body length of more than 7 cm, although the very long legs make them look 
much larger. The body of the animal is divided into two parts, the clearly segmented abdo- 
men and the head and thorax which are fused into one unit. The jaws are huge and pincer 
shaped. Color varies according to species, but many species are brown/yellowish, while a 
minority are dark, and some are even patterned. 

Where do they live? Sun spiders can be found in Africa and east into India and Indonesia. 
Many species are also known from the New World. They can be found in a variety of 
habitats, including forests and grasslands; however, they seemed to have developed an affin- 
ity for the drier parts of the world. 

Red Romans and Beard Trimmers? 

Few people would know what a sun spider is, let alone have seen a living specimen, and it is 
to the deserts of the world you must go if you want to see what surely rates as one the oddest 
members in that band of animal oddities, the arachnids. Sun spider is an ironic choice of name 
for an animal that is no great sun worshipper. Even the diurnal species try to keep out of the 
scorching, unforgiving rays of the tropical sun as much as possible. The appearance of the sun 
spider is nothing short of disconcerting. They are reminiscent of the scuttling, malevolent crea- 
tures beloved by science-fiction film makers. Add the grotesqueness of their appearance to the 
speed at which they can move, and you have an animal that makes a tarantula seem benign as a 
guinea pig. 



272 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


Although they look mean, the sun spiders are harmless, well, to humans at least. Their sin- 
gle most impressive characteristic and that which attracts the most attention from arachnid aficio- 
nados is their huge chelicerae. They are massive, and size for size are probably the largest jaws in 
the animal kingdom. They sprout from the head like an elaborate pair of nut crackers. Where they 
join the head, they bulge outward, swelled by the enormous muscles within. These magnificent 
mouthparts give the animal a rather head-heavy look. Either side of these huge chelicerae are long 
appendages that resemble thin legs. These are in fact the pedipalps, important sensory organs used 
in a variety of situations. Behind these pedipalps are the arachnid complement of four pairs of 
walking legs. These legs enable the sun spider to move with grace and poise under normal cir- 
cumstances, but when threatened, they can propel the beast to more than 16 km/h, an impressive 
speed for such a small animal. Scaled up, this would be equivalent to a running human reaching 
a speed of almost 500 km/h. With such a turn of pace and those jaws, the sun spider is a capable 
predator, able to get the better of just about any smaller animal. The eyes can detect movement, 
probably form rudimentary images, but the numerous long, stiff hairs all over the animal’s legs alert 
it to tiny fluctuations in air pressure, indicating the proximity of potential prey. Once the prey has 
been subdued, the jaws work like an effective pair of shears, slicing it up and allowing digestive flu- 
ids to permeate and dissolve the soft inner parts. The resultant soup is then taken into the mouth. 

On this diet of invertebrates, small reptiles and other creatures, the sun spider grows quickly 
and may shed its skin nine times before it reaches maturity. Apart from food, a mature sun spi- 
der must also seek out a mate. This is left to the male, who must sniff out a receptive partner and 
engage in copulation, which, in the tradition of the arachnids, is a perilous affair. To the female, 
the male is little more than a fat snack, so to stand any chance of perpetuating the species, the 
male approaches his intended mate very gingerly. Any false move will see him trapped in the 
formidable jaws. He uses his long, sensitive pedipalps to stroke the female, which seems to put 
her in some form of trance. With a chivalrous air, he carefully picks her up in his jaws and car- 
ries her a short distance before placing her carefully on her side. From his genital opening he 
produces a small packet of sperm that he delicately picks up in his chelicerae. He introduces this 
spermatophore into the female’s genital aperture and quickly hops away before the inseminated 
female regains her senses and turns on him. 

♦ Approximately 900 species of sun spider are known from around the world. In the 
United States, there are a few species in Florida and more than 100 in the Southwest. 
Some species are even found as far north as Canada. Unlike some other large arach- 
nids, they tend to be seasonal species, living out their whole life in a single year. 

♦ They are known by a variety of names other than sun spider; these include, wind 
scorpion, camel spider, red roman, haarskeerders, and baardskeerders. The latter two 
are the most interesting and refer to the belief that a female sun spider carrying eggs 
will use hair clipped from humans and animals to line her subterranean nest, A sun 
spider has never been witnessed snipping at a sleeping man’s beard with its jaws, but 
nests have certainly been found to contain fur. 

♦ It is also the mistaken belief that a sun spider will actively pursue a human it chances 
upon in its habitat. The reason for this is that although the sun spider is a creature of 
warm, arid places, it keeps out of the direct sun light as much as possible. The shadow 
cast by a human is a convenient source of shade, and it is only this shade that the 
arachnid is pursuing. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 273 


♦ Another unique feature of the sun spider is the characteristic racquet or malleoli or- 
gans, which can be found along the underside of the back legs of certain species. The 
function of these, like the pectines of scorpions, is unknown, although they are prob- 
ably sensory, 

♦ As the sun spiders actually shun solar rays, the Latin name solifuge is much more apt 
as this translates as “fleeing from the sun.”

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Cycliophora

Order: Symbiida 



274 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


What do they look like? These are microscopic animals. The females are slightly less than dou- 
ble the width of a human hair, whereas the males are only one quarter this size. In shape, the 
adult resembles a miniscule urn, with a short stalk at its back end and a crown of short hairs 
at the other. 

Where do they live? Symbion has so far been around the coast of Norway and in the Mediter- 
ranean. It lives on Norwegian lobster and has been recorded at depths of 20-40 m. 

The Strangest of the Strange 

Just before Christmas in 1995, two zoologists from Denmark announced the discovery of a new 
animal from the Kattegats Straits, Their discovery was heralded as the “zoological highlight of 
the decade.” The new animal was so odd that it didn’t fit into any of the accepted categories of 
animal life (phyla). A new phylum had to be created to accommodate it. 

The animal had actually first been observed in the 1960s, but it had gone undetected for 
so long because of its small size and strange habits, Symbion, for much of its life, lives on the 
bristles that grow on the mouthparts of the Norwegian lobster, commonly known to many 
people as scampi, Dublin bay prawns, or langoustines. Apart from this most unusual habitat, 
Symbion also has a bizarre life cycle, composed of a variety of forms, the most obvious of 
which is the feeding stage. At this point, Symbion is asexual, so there are no males or females. 
This asexual feeding stage is found attached to the bristles around the lobster’s mouth. It fixes 
itself to these hairs with a small adhesive disk at the back end of its body. At its head end there 
is a coronet of small hairs (cilia), which it uses to engulf edible particles that have come adrift 
from the lobster’s mouth. This food is funneled down into the mouth and into the loop of 
the gut. Undigested food passes from the anus, which opens near the thin stalk of the feeding 
crown. 

To continue the species, the feeding stage reproduces asexually by a process known as bud- 
ding. Small offshoots develop on the body of the feeding stage and develop in to males and 
females, which represent the sexual stage of Symbion. The males are very simple. They have no 
mouth or anus and lack even the rudiments of an alimentary canal. What they do have, however, 
is well-developed genitalia. A male detaches from the asexual, feeding stage and drifts through 
the water, hopefully to find himself a feeding stage specimen containing a developing female, 
which he will impregnate with his penis. The inseminated female leaves the body of the asexual 
stage, which has nurtured her, to find a place of her own on the lobster’s bristles. The life of the 
female is short, and before long, her digestive organs deteriorate and are reordered as a larva. 
This larva turns into a young asexual feeding stage, and it breaks its way from the shell of the fe- 
male and swims off to find a suitable place to fix itself on the lobster, where it will grow to begin 
the complex process all over again. 

♦ Since Symbion was discovered, other similar species have been found in distant loca- 
tions from the original spot off the coast of Denmark. New species have been found 
on the mouth bristles of American lobsters and European lobsters, extending the 
distribution of these unusual animals to include the West Atlantic and the Mediter- 
ranean. Close examination of other marine crustaceans may yield even more species, 

♦ Although Symbion was first observed in the 1960s, it took many years for microscopy 
to become sufficiently advanced to be able to see the features which make this animal 
unique. 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 275 


♦ One of the scientists who discovered this species, Reinhardt Kristensen, has also 
discovered two other, completely new groups of animals. In 1983, he discovered the 
animals known as loriciferans and in 1994 the micrognathozoans. Both of these are 
very small marine animals that had simply been overlooked. The discovery of these 
animals is important as they add another branch to the already busy tree of life. They 
also show how animal life has evolved into a multitude of different forms to exploit 
different habitats. The animal life on earth is typically classified into 35 major groups 
(phyla) and more are being classified as our understanding of how animals are related 
increases. Our ability to decipher the genetic code of a species has shed an incredible 
amount of light on how different groups of animals are related. Reading the genetic 
code has shown us that animals previously thought to be only distantly related are in 
fact quite similar and vice versa, 

♦ The marine environment continues to throw up all sorts of biological surprises. One 
very rich habitat for new types of animal life is the intricate network of microscopic, 
water-filled channels and passages that exist between the sand grains of the seabed. 
The animals that dwell here are known as meiofauna. They squirm among the sand 
grains, eking out an existence in this strange, miniature world. 

♦ The sexual reproductive cycle of Symbion is triggered when the host lobster molts its 
skin in order to grow. In one way or another, its little passengers sense this and begin 
the production of males and females, 

♦ There is still much we don’t understand about the life of Symbion. They are so small 
that it is very difficult to study live specimens without exposing them to the bright 
lights and high temperatures found beneath the gaze of a powerful microscope.

WATER BEARS 

Scientific name: Tardigrades 
Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Tardigrada 

Class: Heterotardigrada, Mesotardigrada and Eutardigrada 
Order: many 
Family: many 

What do they look like? Water bears are tiny, compact creatures with four pairs of stumpy legs 
ending in claws. The majority are no longer than 0.3-0.5 mm, although some reach 1.2 mm. 
There are four body segments and the head ends in a snoutlike projection. Long filaments 
project from the body of some species. They can be red, purple, blue, olive, yellow, brown, or 
orange. 

Where do they live? Tardigrades have been identified from a huge variety of habitats, although 
many species have been found inhabiting the water films surrounding terrestrial mosses and 
lichens. They are found all over the world. 



276 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 



Water Bears — When its habitat dries, the tardigrade becomes almost lifeless and takes on a barrel-like 
shape. (Mike Shanahan) 


Clinging on to Life 

Dormancy, in its many forms, is a common phenomenon in the animal world. Many creatures 
have evolved reproductive strategies, such as resistant eggs and so forth, to survive extreme con- 
ditions, but the water bears, tiny and overlooked though they are, must be the toughest animals 
on the planet. They inhabit ephemeral pools or the water film around mosses, lichens, or soil 
particles, and when their habitat dries up, they can enter a state of deathlike, suspended anima- 
tion, known as cryptobiosis (Greek for “hidden life”). In this state, water bears have been shown 
to survive amazingly harsh conditions. They can tolerate temperatures ranging from close to 
absolute zero (much colder than liquid nitrogen) up to 250°C (hotter than an oven). They can 
also survive X-ray bombardment, the conditions inside a vacuum, and pressures equivalent to 
6,000 atmospheres. Entering the state of cryptobiosis is no mean feat and is not something the 
water bear does lightly. The process takes several days, and the animal’s body changes from that 
of a charming, stubby-legged critter to little more than a featureless speck that you would be 
hard pressed to identify as an animal. The changes include gradual dehydration where water 
molecules are replaced by glycerol and a simple sugar — trehalose. These take over the role of 
water in maintaining the structure of large molecules and cellular features (i.e,, DNA, proteins 
and cellular membranes). It is fair to say that a water bear in a state of cryptobiosis is essentially 
a dried out husk in which the spark of life is vanishingly faint — the basic processes of metabo- 
lism fall to almost immeasurable levels (0.01 percent of normal). Although the water bear is 
on the cusp of death, cryptobiosis ceases as soon as life giving water returns. The animal slowly 
resumes its normal shape and continues with its life, apparently none the worse for wear. This 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 277 


ability not only makes the water bears in- 
credibly tough, but it also makes them very 
long lived. No one is exactly sure how long 
these animals can remain dormant for, but 
it could be centuries or even millennia. The 
fact is that the ability to become cryptobi- 
otic is a huge advantage to any animal liv- 
ing in a habitat that dries out periodically, 
as they can survive the lean periods, barely 
ticking over, and bounce back as soon as 
conditions become favorable again. 


♦ There are approximately 700 species of water bear, but due to their small size and 
habitat they are often overlooked, and it is highly likely that there are many more spe- 
cies as yet unidentified, especially in the deep oceans. 

♦ Due to the slow, deliberate motion and endearing appearance of these animals, Tho- 
mas Huxley, the English naturalist, gave them the name water bears, which seems to 
have stuck. 

♦ The water bear forms what is known as a tun during cryptobiosis. Their body contracts 
and any recognizable features disappear. The term tun comes from the similarity of 
these animals, in their deathlike state, to the large kegs once used to hold wine and beer, 

♦ With repeated bouts of cryptobiosis, a water bear’s 30-month life span can be in- 
creased to at least 70 years, and possibly far longer. 

♦ Water bears in the cryptobiotic state can not only survive extremes of temperature and 
pressure but also huge doses of radiation. The dose of radiation required to kill a water 
bear in cryptobiosis is at least 1,000 times greater than the fatal dose for a human. 

♦ Relatives of the water bears, the rotifers and nematodes, are also captains of cryp- 
tobiosis, Even certain amphibians can tolerate periods of intense cold, falling into 
a dormant state with characteristics similar to cryptobiosis, but they lack the sheer 
hardiness of the water bears. The size and complexity of the general vertebrate body 
makes true cryptobiosis impossible; however, the survival of removed vertebrate or- 
gans can be greatly extended by cooling them and treating them with trehalose. 

♦ Some aquatic water bears also have an interesting approach to reproduction. These ani- 
mals like many other invertebrates must shed their skin in order to grow, and it is at the 
point of molting that the male mates with the female and deposits his sperm into the 
space between the new and old skin. The female lays her eggs into the shed skin where 
they are fertilized. The young can then develop in the safety of this ready-made egg case, 

♦ Water bears feed by sucking up liquid. Some pierce plant cells with stylets that can be 
projected from the mouth, while some of the smaller tardigrades are predatory, pierc- 
ing the bodies of other small animals with their stylets and sucking them dry.

^ Go Look! 

You can look for these animals yourself, especially if 
you have a microscope. A handful of moss or lichen 
can be soaked in distilled water for a few days and then 
squeezed or shaken to release the water bears, which can 
be examined under a microscope. Notice the four pairs 
of legs and the slow, sedate way in which they move. Your 
chances of seeing a water bear can be improved by re- 
moving a small quantity of moss or lichen from a clean 
habitat, as they are very sensitive to pollutants.

WATER SPIDER 



Water Spider — The water spider carries a bubble of air to its diving bell 
beneath the hairs on its abdomen. (Mike Shanahan) 


Scientific name: Argyroneta aquatica 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Arthropoda 
Class: Arachnida 
Order: Araneae 
Family: Agyronetidae 

What does it look like? The water spider out of water is a rather drab specimen. It has a 

mousy dark grey abdomen. The body of a fully grown female is between 8 and 15 mm long, 
although specimens 20 mm long are known. Males are between 9 and 12 mm long. 

Where does it live? This spider is widely distributed throughout Europe and northern Asia, 
and where it occurs it can be often be found in quite large numbers. It prefers pools of water 
rather than streams and rivers, and it can be found in lakes, ponds, and ditches. 

A Silken Diving Bell 

Spiders, with their eight legs, tough little bodies, and ability to make webs and other silken 

structures are almost archetypal land lubbers — or so you would think. There is one spider, the 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 279 


water spider, which has moved from the land and back to the ancestral home of all life: the water. 
This amazing and rarely seen animal has retained the ability to produce silk from its back end, 
and in the aquatic environment, it has put this skill to very good use. In the sheltered confines of a 
pond or perhaps a large ditch, the spider spins what looks like a silken balloon anchored to stems 
of aquatic vegetation. To the underwater observer this structure is mysteriously silver, like an im- 
perfect sphere of mercury suspended in the water. The silvery effect is actually due to the presence 
of air. The little, tightly woven silk balloon is actually a neat diving bell, and it is in this silvered 
chamber the spider resides. Like a normal, land- dwelling, web-building spider, this species spends 
much of it time in the confines of its retreat, drawing on its supply of air and waiting for a tasty 
snack to swim or drift by. The water spider is a fairly large spider, and with its potent venom, it 
can subdue animals as large as tadpoles — dashing out from its retreat to deliver a deadly bite, 

A diving bell underwater is all well and good, but how on earth does this animal replenish 
its supply of air? It’s not as though it has a support ship on the surface piping oxygen down 
to it. Each time one of these spiders builds a diving bell, it must ascend to the surface and 
collect air under the hairs that clothe its abdomen and legs. Enshrouded it what appears to 
be a suit of quicksilver, the spider descends to its bell and wipes the air from its body into the 
bell. As soon as the bell is full, it is a self-replenishing air supply. Oxygen from the surround- 
ing water percolates in to the bell giving the arachnid a self sustaining, underwater breathing 
apparatus. 

Even more fascinating is the way these animals go about mating. An ardent male comes along 
and, without a care for personal space, builds a diving bell right next to that of a mature female. 
If this were not presuming enough, he then proceeds to build a small tunnel connecting the two 
bells. Seemingly, the female is impressed by the male’s behavior, and he breaks through the wall 
into her bell where the two mate. The female lays between 30 and 70 eggs in her diving bell, and 
the spiderlings that eventually hatch will leave this refuge and search for habitat of their own, 
traversing land where they have to. 

♦ Of all the spiders, the water spider is the only species that has taken to an aquatic 
existence. There are other spiders that are semiaquatic, living on or around water. 

One such example is the raft spider. These big, impressive looking spiders can move 
around on the meniscus of small bodies of water, especially where there is abundant 
vegetation to act as a base for their rafting activities. They use the surface film of the 
water as a sort of web, detecting faint ripples of prey beneath the surface. They plunge 
through the meniscus and grab the prey. They are large enough to subdue small fish 
and amphibians. 

♦ Although the water spider spends its life in an aquatic environment, it must still 
breathe air. Truly aquatic animals can extract the oxygen in water through the struc- 
tures known as gills. Technically, the diving bell of the spider acts like a gill as oxygen 
diffuses into it from the surrounding water, 

♦ The water spider can use its long legs to swim freely in the water while on its hunting 
forays, 

♦ Although the water spider is quite big and has powerful fangs, robust enough to 
pierce human skin, they are eaten by fish and frogs. The usual prey of this spider is 
the larvae and nymphs of various aquatic insects and crustaceans. The captured prey 
of the spider is taken back to the diving bell where it is consumed. 



280 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


♦ Uncharacteristic for a spider, male diving spiders are the same size or larger than fe- 
males, This reverses the normal situation of a male spider tentatively approaching a 
female when it comes to mating. In water spiders it is the female who must be wary of 
the male, for he is big enough to overpower and kill her. 

♦ The water spider is one of the only spiders in Europe that has a bite that can be con- 
sidered to be even remotely dangerous. The bite is painful and the symptoms of itch- 
ing, shivering, vomiting and fever can last for as long as three days.

ZOMBIE WORM 



Zombie Worm — The zombie worms root-like 
projections house bacteria that break down the 
marrow in a dead whales bones. (Mike Shanahan) 



Zombie Worms — A zombie worm under a micro- 
scope. The trunk and feathery gills can be clearly 
seen. The root-like mass is the part of the worm that 
grows inside the whale bone. (Greg Rouse and 

Lbard 


Scientific name: Osedax frankpressi 

Scientific classification: 

Phylum: Annelida 
Class: Polychaeta 
Order: Sabellida 
Family: Siboglinidae 

What does it look like? These are small animals, the largest yet found are about as long as an 
adults index finger and the thickness of a pencil. They lack a mouth, stomach, eyes, and 
limbs. There is a muscular, extendable reddish-colored trunk that bears a crown of red 
tentacles or plumes. Beneath the trunk there is a greenish, knotted, root-like mass. 

Where does it live? These are animals of the seabed where they make their living on the car- 
casses of whales and other large, dead sea animals. Individuals have been found in very deep 



PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 281 


water (2,800 m) off the Californian coast, while others have been found off the west coast of 
Sweden in water only 120 m deep. 

Marine, Marrow Munchers 

In February 2002, a remotely operated submersible discovered the decomposing corpse of a young 
grey whale 2,800 m under the waves at the bottom of the Monterey Canyon. The powerful lights of 
the submersible illuminated the remains, revealing numerous small, red tufts that were retracted 
as the manipulator arm investigated the bones. The operators back on board the mother ship 
could see they were a worm of sorts, but a type that had never been seen before. The submersible 
collected a section of bone and its covering of worms for examination at the surface. 

The worms, upon inspection, turned out to be very odd indeed. The red tufts and muscular 
trunk was only a portion of the animal as the rest was concealed inside the bone of the deal 
whale. Careful dissection of the bone revealed the rest of the worm extended out in the mar- 
row of the bone cavity in the same way as the roots of plant snake out through the soil. These 
so-called roots were green in color, and further examination showed they were packed with bac- 
teria. The bacteria in these roots were digesting the fats and oils in the whale marrow, not only 
to sustain themselves but also to nourish the worm which housed them. This was the first time 
symbiotic bacteria had been found that thrived on fats and oils, and it enabled the worms to 
exploit the bonanza of a dead whale on the nutritionally poor seabed. The tufts of the worm are 
gills and are red because they have hemoglobin running through them. 

The unique feeding behavior of these worms was not the only peculiar thing about them as 
it was soon realized that all the specimens they were seeing were females laden with eggs; there 
was no sign of any males. Eventually the males were found, but they were absolutely tiny and 
living inside the trunk of the female. One female worm was found to have 111 miniscule males 
living inside her. These males were scarcely more than larvae, but they were packed with sperm 
to fertilize the eggs of their mighty mate. 

How the males find their partners in the vastness of the ocean is not fully understood, but 
it is probably in a way very similar to the spoon worms featured earlier in the book. The female 
worms release huge numbers of eggs. These eggs hatch into larvae that drift around the oceans 
sustained by a store of yolk. If they are exceptionally lucky, they may alight on the decompos- 
ing body of a whale and develop into a female, which sends her roots down into the nutritious 
marrow of the whale. If they are luckier still the larvae may settle on a female, in which case it 
undergoes the very minor transformation needed to turn it into a male before heading straight 
for the security of the female’s innards. Those larvae that are unfortunate enough to miss a whale 
corpse or female of their species simply perish, a fate which befalls the vast majority of them. 

♦ The zombie worms are new to science, and there is a great deal still to learn about 
them. Currently, three species are known, Osedax frankpressi, O. rubiplumus, and 
O. mucofloris. The first two species were found on the grey whale corpse off Califor- 
nia, discovered by Bob Vrijenhoek, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay aquarium 
research institute, while the third was found on a minke whale that was purposefully 
deposited in 120 m of water off the coast of Sweden. The original two species led ma- 
rine biologists to assume that zombie worms were creatures of very deep water, but 
the Swedish species showed that they are probably to be found in all regions of the 



282 EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS 


seas as long as there are dead whales. Since then, as many as 11 new species of Osedax 
have been discovered. 

♦ It has been suggested that before hunting brought the populations of the great whales 
to their knees, many more species of zombie worm existed. The species we find today 
are maybe just a fraction of those that once sapped the marrow of dead whales, 

♦ Dead whales represent a feast for deep-sea animals, and soon after one hits the 
sea bottom, swimming, floating, and crawling creatures will converge from far and 
wide to take advantage of this bounteous supply of food. A dead whale, represents a 
30-150 ton chunk of edible matter large enough to sustain huge numbers of deep-sea 
animals for many years. Normally, the only source of nourishment in the impover- 
ished environment of the deep seabed is the matter which falls from shallow waters. 
This is known as marine snow, and a single whale fall is equivalent to approximately 
1,000 years of this slow nutrient influx. 

♦ The zombie worms are only a few of the animals that take advantage of whale falls. 
Firstly, the flesh of the dead whale will be scavenged by sharks, fish, hagfish, and poly- 
chaete worms. Only when the blubber and muscle has been cleared can the zombie 
worms take up their positions on the exposed bones. Of course, many animals are 
drawn to the carcass to prey on the great density of scavengers and as result the huge, 
dead mammal supports an entire oasis of life for several years, even decades, until 
nothing but its bones lie amid the ooze of the seafloor.
